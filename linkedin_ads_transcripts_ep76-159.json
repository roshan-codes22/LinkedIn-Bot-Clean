I share my whole playbook for getting the most out of your in person events on this week’s episode of the LinkedIn Ads Show.\nWelcome to the LinkedIn Ads Show. Here’s your host, AJ Wilcox.\nHey LinkedIn Ads fanatics. As he said, I’m AJ Wilcox. I’m the host of the weekly podcast, the LinkedIn Ads Show. I’m thrilled to welcome you to the show for advanced B2B I’m thrilled to welcome you to the show for advanced B2B marketers who are looking to evolve and master their LinkedIn Ads craft. And of course achieve true pro status.\nSo it’s officially event season. And as you’re attending and presenting at trade shows and conferences and other in person events, you may want to leverage your LinkedIn Ads to get more attention for your sales team or for you while you’re there. We’ve found a lot of success in promoting our clients at their events that they’re attending using our LinkedIn ads. And I want to share with you my entire playbook.\nWe’ll cover number one, how to target your event attendees. Number two, which ad types to use. Number three, What exactly do you want to promote? And then number four, when do you promote it? What your timing is. And as a bonus, we’ll talk about what you can do from an organic standpoint to also help your ads.\nThe LinkedIn Ads Show is proudly brought to you by B2Linked.com, the LinkedIn Ads experts.\nB2Linked is the ad agency 100 percent dedicated to LinkedIn Ads. And we have been ever since 2014. You know, back before it was cool. We build custom strategies for every account we work with. You get to work directly with me and my local team. You won’t get any sort of a cookie cutter approach or standard account templates from us. We use custom strategies that I developed after spending over 150 million on the platform, and we’re insanely good at saving you money. We always save our clients more than we charge. So it’s kind of like getting the very best in the biz, but for free. If you’d like to explore partnering with us on your LinkedIn ads management, schedule your free discovery call at B2Linked.com/discovery.\nFirst off in the news, two recent changes. These actually happened during the month of July, and so you should all be seeing these inside of your account. The first is LinkedIn changed its definition for what an impression and a click are from a video ad. And this is really good. I think this is a great change. The way it works is if an ad doesn’t actually start to play, LinkedIn will not call that an impression. And then same thing with clicks. If someone clicks on one of the ads, but the video hasn’t started to play, they don’t call that a click. So what it means to you advertisers is any of those impressions and clicks that you get, that someone ends up taking action on your video ad before it started to play. Those are all going to be free. And you know, I love free advertising on LinkedIn. I tend to see this a lot when someone is looking at video ads on a poor connection. You don’t want to call that an impression if they didn’t actually watch your video and it’s a video ad. And of course, you don’t want to get charged for that click either. So I’m a big fan of this change.\nAnother change is actually one I’ve been asking for for a long time. It caused a lot of headaches. And that is, if you’re running any sort of a sponsored messaging campaign, your sends show up as part of your impressions column count. And your opens show up as part of your clicks column. So whenever someone came to me and said, wow, we have a 50 percent click through rate and a 50 cent cost per click. I would know immediately, oh, you are running sponsored messaging ads, and you’re not actually taking into account what the real metrics are. Of course, I’m sure LinkedIn was really happy with people thinking that they were having a ton of success using these sponsored messaging campaigns. But realistically, when they followed it through and realized that even though they were getting clicks for 50 cents, now all of a sudden, they have ginormous cost per conversion. And eventually they’d realize they were doing something wrong, or LinkedIn was reporting it wrong.\nSo now as of mid July in 2024, LinkedIn’s going to start putting all of those metrics in the proper columns. That means when you’re running sponsored messaging, none of your performance is going to show up in either your impressions or clicks. Instead, if you look under your columns, or sponsored messaging, there you will find your opens, your sends, and your sponsored messaging clicks. All of these will have their own columns as you export right from campaign manager into Excel. And that’s where I do a lot of my analysis. So that’s where I look for it now too.\nIf any of you have built your, your cost per click and your click through rate formulas based off of what I’ve shared before, all of those formulas will still work. What they did is they just took out any time LinkedIn was calling an open a click and a send an impression.\nThe result that you might notice from these changes, specifically for video, you might also see your video click counts decrease.\nYou might see your CPMs and video view rates, they might increase. You might see that your click through rates and engagement rates might decrease. But overall, I think this is much better to abide by these definitions. It’s a lot more true to what’s actually happening.\nWith sponsored messaging, you might just find that if you’re just looking at sponsored messaging campaigns, under impressions and clicks and click through rate, you might just see a dash or a zero, something along those lines.\nAll right. I wanted to highlight a review that we got on Apple podcasts.\nAnd I love this one. The title is, This show has completely transformed my LinkedIn Ads. Janie Tallarico, who runs Tallarico Marketing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She said, &quot;I’ve run Facebook ads for years and thought LinkedIn ads would be quite similar. Frustrated by performance, I found AJ’s podcast and have learned the platform is really different for meta ads. AJ shares real info, not fluffy strategies. He really shares what to do with LinkedIn ads, like the nitty gritty things. I launched all new LinkedIn campaigns last month following AJ’s advice on the podcast, and our results have been incredible. Cost per click is $2 cheaper, and leads have gone up without sacrificing lead quality. I’m blown away. This podcast is a must listen for any digital marketer. Thank you, AJ.&quot;\nJanie, thank you so much for leaving such a kind review. I’m so glad. Thank you for sharing your results, too. I couldn’t be prouder any time that I hear that when I share some advice, and it results in you being able to pay less and get better performance for your LinkedIn ads, oh, it warms my little ginger heart.\nDo you have a question, a review, or feedback for the show? You can either message me on LinkedIn privately, my DMs are free and open, or you can email us at podcast@B2Linked.com. You can attach a voice recording from you that I can play right here on the show, or, or you can send the boring text and I’ll just read it. And as always, I’m happy to keep you anonymous or shout you out and share your details. I want to feature you.\nAll right, without further ado, let’s hit it.\nFirst, let’s jump into the types of targeting that you want to do to reach your event attendees. The very best option here is with list targeting. So ask yourself these questions. Do you have either a contact list or a company list of the attendees that are coming to the event? Maybe you don’t have this year’s attendees, but do you happen to have last year’s attendees? Obviously, the more recent the better. But I’ve found a lot of times that if a company attended last year, they’re going to be a lot more likely to attend this year as well.\nYou can, of course, target the contact list, if you have one. That means you’re going to reach people who attended last year or who are signed up to attend this year. That’s great. But oftentimes, that person may not match 100 percent with LinkedIn’s records, and so you might end up missing that person. So, what I love to do, and this is something that we covered in episode 120, is you can take your contact list and turn it into a company list. Companies match at a much higher rate than contact lists. Plus, if any of them don’t match, you can look and see which ones that you uploaded did not match. You can go and do more research, and then upload a list that gets a 100 percent match rate. So if you use a company list to target, and then layer on your things like job functions and seniorities, You end up getting, usually, the person that you had on the contact list as well, but you now get their opportunity to hit their colleagues, their co workers, their boss, their boss’s boss. Really, whoever it is that you want to hit there.\nBut let’s say that you don’t have any lists. Okay, that’s not a great place to start out with. But, it doesn’t stop you or preclude you from still advertising on LinkedIn for this event. What we’ll do is we’ll use LinkedIn’s native targeting to reach the kind of professional that you want to reach there at the show. And we’re going to target them just while they’re in the city of the event. It’s not going to be nearly as precise as if we could just target the building that the event is in, but LinkedIn only lets us target down to the city, so we make the best with what we’ve got.\nNow, usually I recommend targeting the geography with the permanent only feature, but for this, we actually do want to reach people who are just even temporarily in that city. So what we’re going to do is target the city on recent or permanent geography, which is the default. So you don’t actually have to change anything here. And then you set up your persona targeting the way that you normally would with LinkedIn Ads.\nIf you end up getting a huge audience size, my recommendation is to bid really low because you want to spend the least amount possible while maximizing your reach of that kind of professional in hopes that you’re going to reach those who are at the event. And of course, there will be spillover if you’re using just LinkedIn’s native targeting. If an event’s being held in San Francisco, you’re going to reach all of those professionals that are in San Francisco, as well as those who’ve come in just for this event. Like I said, not as clean, but hey, we work with what we’ve got. So those are our two types of targeting.\nNow, let’s move on to the ad types that you might want to run. I absolutely love running conversation ads, and I’d actually even add click to message ads to this recommendation as well. These come across as a very VIP, like, personal invitation, and so for that reason, it’s really good. If you have something VIP or special to invite someone to, this is the very best way to do it. You invite them through a conversation ad, so it feels like a personal invitation. And this is because it comes from an individual, you can insert their, like, I like to insert first name, like, hey, first name. It’s going to come to them personalized, and because it shows up in their messages, it really does feel very personal.\nNow usually, conversation ads, message ads, they end up with an average open rate of about 55%. When we’ve run this for events, We got 67%, so significantly better, 12% better. So considerably better open rates. And usually, message ads click through rates are like 3. 2%, we average 16. 6%. This is of course contingent on the fact that you’ve got something special to invite someone to.\nAlright, next ad format I want to point out is using Thought Leader Ads. For those of you who know me, this is not going to be a surprise at all. I love Thought Leader Ads. What I suggest doing is promote a company reps post when they’re posting about attending the show. Make sure they point out anything fun or special that’s going on, that they’ll want to participate in.\nFor a recent event, we ran two very different Thought Leader ads, and both posts ended up averaging about a 10% click through rate. Which is incredible, because if you just had a company post that you were saying like, Hey, we’re at this event, come check us out, I guarantee it would probably get like half of a percent. Of course, I can’t actually guarantee your performance, but you get what I’m saying.\nThe next ad format that you should consider is single image sponsored content. Single image ads are in the news feed, and they are still really good if you can’t promote personal posts, or, as you probably know from listening to me, with Thought Leader Ads, we can only run on the engagement objective, and then LinkedIn is charging you for all of the clicks to things like, to see more of the post, and, you know, any sort of interaction. So, if you’re worried about too many of your clicks going to unhelpful interactions, like, see more, and Liking and commenting, then single image ads from your company might be the best option because you can set it to only pay when someone clicks on your landing page. Then single image ads from your company page might make the most sense because you can set it with a website visits objective, meaning you only pay for any click that goes to your landing page. I’ve mentioned before that most of the time these kinds of ads get around a 0.45% click through rate, we were averaging 1. 57 on this last campaign, so three times the average, super cool. I’ll also throw out this option, text ads. Text ads are a really good way of getting your logo in front of your target audience for very cheap. They only show up on desktop, and when someone does click them, it costs very little, like all the way down to $2 per click.\nObviously, most people who are traveling for events, they’re not on desktop, they’re on mobile. So you might find that your text ads aren’t serving the purpose you’re hoping. But to me, they are so easy to set up, and they’re such a cheap way of staying in front of your target audience and keeping you top of mind, I think they’re probably still worthwhile to set up. So what do you actually promote when you’re running these ads cause you have to have something to promote. Well, if you’re presenting or sponsoring, you obviously want to encourage attendees to come and visit your booth or attend the talk.\nI once worked for a brand who did an unofficial sponsorship. where they rented out a place that was nearby, and they were not paying the conference for this sponsorship, but they were promoting the fact that if you come here, you’ll get free drinks. Just remember, people are getting a lot of competing messages at the show, so it really helps you stand out if there is something special, exclusive, fun, interesting, at meetup, get together, whatever.\nAt one of our recent client events that we were promoting, they had an F1 driving simulator and other really cool things in their booth. Which, it was a lot more effective to drive traffic to that booth, rather than just saying, come talk to us at our booth and we’ll show you our product. People either don’t want that, or they have a lot of other competing things for their attention, and they might need a little bit of extra of a draw.\nYou can also host dinners and lunches, as well as try to schedule one on one meals or meetings with attendees. Things like free meals, free drinks, those are a really good draw.\nSo now that you know what to promote, Go Now let’s talk about the timing. I have this broken up in my mind in three different portions. There’s the time leading up to the event, there’s the during the event, and then the post event follow up. In the weeks, maybe even the month leading up to the event, I like to advertise to those that you know are likely to attend, those that are in our lists.\nTry to reach them with personal invites to get on people’s calendars and to start filling up your salespeople or your schedules while you’re there. And obviously when you do this, try to offer a benefit of some kind that will actually encourage people to meet with you.\nObviously, if you’re not using lists here, you would just be advertising to all the professionals who fit your criteria in the city of the conference before people get there, that’s probably not overly going to be helpful. So, definitely start out with lists, but then during the event, you can advertise both to your lists and to your LinkedIn native targeting. You target your audience in the city’s location Your list of attendees and then at the very end of the event I always recommend shutting them off the midnight of the last day of the event, shut it off. Most people have left the city.\nAnd then after the event, create retargeting audiences for anyone who interacted with your ads that were shown during the event. You now have retargeting audiences featuring all of those people who attended and were interested enough to interact. Then roll all of those retargeting audiences into your existing evergreen retargeting campaign. I usually call these our middle of the funnel stage campaigns and continue to stay in front of them.\nI did promise a little bit of a bonus on the organic promotion of events. Here are some tips for you.\nBefore the event, have representatives from your company post about them attending, what they’re excited for, and anything else that you think would be really exciting. Bonus points if they’re offering something to attendees that they’d be excited about. Maybe a contest, a VIP invite, etc. You can obviously boost these as thought leader ads leading up to the event, or even possibly during it.\nAnd then I got this idea from one of our clients. Thank you, Diane. She said, do a post conference wrap up post. Acknowledge a great event, some key takeaways, individual speakers. Include photos, tag people, these are guaranteed to be shared by those who get tagged. And be sincere, not spammy.\nAnd then an extra little tip for me, if you’ll want to promote this as a thought leader ad, make sure that it’s only a single image. It’s really easy to add lots of images to a post, but then we can’t sponsor it as a Thought Leader Ad.\nDiane found a sweet spot of the morning of the event, posting between 7 AM seems to be the sweet spot before conference activities get going, and always use the event hashtags when you’re promoting it organically, because then you’ll get some good initial organic views from people who are really interested in the event. And of course, you can always go back and edit the post later to remove tags, remove other sorts of links. And then when you end up sponsoring it later as a Thought Leader Ad, you don’t have to worry about paying for clicks to all kinds of other links.\nIf you’re not already a member of the LinkedIn Ads fanatics community, go right now, drop everything, drop some weights if you’re lifting right now, go to fanatics.b2linked.com and you can join us.

That’s right. We’re diving into this interesting ad format on this week’s episode of the LinkedIn Ads Show.\nWelcome to the LinkedIn Ads Show. Here’s your host, AJ Wilcox.\nHey, there LinkedIn Ads fanatics. As he said, I’m AJ Wilcox. I’m the host of the weekly podcast, the LinkedIn Ads Show. I’m thrilled to welcome you to the show for advanced B2B marketers who want to evolve their craft and master LinkedIn Ads.\nSo there’s this ad format called Conversation Ads, and I realized we’ve never had a full podcast episode about them, which is actually funny because I use them really often. I’m gonna share the ins and outs of them, when to use them, and also what makes them perform.\nThe LinkedIn Ads Show is proudly brought to you by B2Linked.com, the LinkedIn Ads experts.\nB2Linked is the ad agency, 100 percent dedicated to LinkedIn ads. And we have been since 2014, you know, back before it was cool. We build a custom strategy for every account we work with. Plus, you get to work directly with me and my local team. You won’t get a cookie cuutter approach or any standard account templates with us. Plus, with the strategies that we’ve developed and our mastery of the platform, we save our clients way more than we charge. So it’s kind of like you’re getting the best in the biz for free. If saving money and increasing your ROI sounds interesting, and you want to explore partnering with us, schedule your free discovery call at B2Linked.com/discovery.\nAlright, first off in the news, there’s a new metric coming to campaign manager, and I just heard about it today. I’m really excited. It’s called audience penetration. Now what this is, is it’s a measure of how many people from our total target audience that we’ve reached with at least one impression. And I think the way it’s calculated is your unique reach divided by the total audience size that you’re going after. So we have reach, and we have our audience size. Why is this interesting? Well, there’s no report that we can generate from LinkedIn to tell us our audience sizes. So if you wanted to calculate this, you would have to go one by one through each campaign to extract it to do the math. Also, the reach number is really suspect, because like we’ve talked about before, it’s It’s averaged together in buckets to try to preserve anonymity in some way. I still don’t know how this works but what it means is I can’t ever trust our frequency numbers or our reach numbers to be precise. But what’s really cool about this number is it seems to react however, you change your time range inside of campaign manager, the number changes. And so I actually have a lot of faith that this is a way that we’re going to be able to calculate. And not worry about the issues that have plagued our, our reach and our frequency numbers.\nSo watch for this coming to your account in coming weeks. I’m guessing it’s either going to be under columns, delivery or columns, engagement, maybe both. Cause I could see it really affecting both, but when you export an ads or a campaigns report, it will be the last column and it’ll be called audience penetration, and it’s a percentage.\nOnce we get this, I’m really interested in running some bidding tests to see if, if you bid higher over a period of time, you can see how much more penetration you got by ranking higher, scoring higher in the auction. I think it’ll be really interesting to see how that auction lever moves to show you, if you’re willing to bid higher, how much more of your audience can you reach. Think it’s also going to give us a clue, if we bid higher, and we can see how high that goes, but won’t go any higher, that can give us a clue of what percentage of that audience is inactive, which is also really good information to know.\nAlright, do you have a question, a review for the show that I can play live, or feedback? Please message me on LinkedIn. My DMs are free and open. You can also email us at podcast@b2linked.com. You can attach a link to a voice recording, and I’ll play you right here live on the show. Or you can send me a boring text answer, or whatever, and I can respond to you there, and read it here on the show. Of course, I’m happy to keep you anonymous, so just let me know if you’d like that, or I can share your details as well and give you a shout out. As always, I want to feature you, LinkedIn Ads fanatics.\nAlright, without further ado, let’s hit it. We’re talking about conversation ads. First of all, what are conversation ads? How are they different from other ad formats? Most of the ad formats that LinkedIn has, show up right in your newsfeed. And those are what we call sponsored content. And there are lots of those. Single image, video, document, etc. Conversation ads are one of the ad formats under sponsored messaging, and where they’re different, they’re not in the newsfeed. They actually only come to you when you are in your messaging box on LinkedIn. I think it’s cute they call it the Inbox because LinkedIn’s in. Anyway. Because they show up as a message, it feels really personal. They actually come from an individual. You get to choose who the individual in your company is. That the message is being sent from. So it feels very personal. It feels very like, very much like an invite, very VIP.\nAs opposed to all the other ad formats where you can say, I only want to pay when someone clicks and takes action. These are a hundred percent pay per send.\nSo you send it to someone with no guarantee that they will see that they got it. Or open it. Or end up clicking on what you want them to click on. And so costs on these, especially to cold audiences can be really high. We oftentimes see these in the like $20 to $55 per click range.\nAnd for quite a while, we’ve had message ads that act like this. Then we got conversation ads. It’s probably been three ish years ago. Conversation ads where it’s the same kind of thing, like message ads, but you get to give people multiple options. It’s not just an email that comes to you and you say, I want to do that or don’t. It actually gives you multiple calls to action as buttons. And when you click them, you can show them something based off of what they clicked on.\nSo they’re really good for things that would work well as a personal invitation. If it’s like, because of who you are in the industry, we want to give you early access, or a sneak peek at something. That’s where the sponsored messaging ad formats work really well.\nThis also works really well if you want to give people multiple options. Back with just message ads, we could only ever give them one option. And if they’re not interested in that one option, let’s say it’s a, get a demo. If they’re not interested in a demo right now, they just leave the message. There’s nothing else they can do. But with conversation ads, you can say, click here. If you want a demo, click on this one. If you want to see more, click over here. If you want to join a webinar and learn more, etc.\nBecause the performance and cost of these are a hundred percent related to whether people open and click. These work a lot better for retargeting than they do for cold audiences. If you end up sending these to cold audiences, they don’t know who you are. They don’t know, like, and trust you. And so when they get your message, they might click open just to see because they’re curious. Or they just want to mark it as read so it doesn’t take up space in their inbox. But they’re probably not going to take the next step. But if this is a retargeting audience, you already have some sort of a relationship built. It feels very personal. And they can perform very, very well.\nAlso, the auction for sponsored content is extremely competitive. We’ve seen that you might have to bid $1, $2, $3 higher to see really big changes happen. But with sponsored messaging, the auction is not very competitive. this video. And so we find that even raising your bid a few cents per send can make a big difference in reaching more people. It’s even totally possible to spend your whole budget without having to bid more than the minimum. It’s pretty cool.\nI think we need to ask, as ads managers, why isn’t the auction very competitive? Why are more marketers not using these? I think a big part of that comes down to the fact that they are very expensive, if you’re looking at just a cost per someone taking action. So they’re kind of limited in use to really special kinds of invites or something for like a tight retargeting audience. Also, they’re really cumbersome to build. If you imagine some sort of a sponsored content ad, you can type, you can hop into a design program, and put together words and an image, and be ready to actually have an ad launch very quickly.\nBut with sponsored messaging ads, there’s a lot of text, and especially with these conversation ads, not only do you have to come up with text, but you have to come up with the whole design of if they click this, then we give them this text. If they click over here, then we show them something different. So they are cumbersome to build, and the conversations are actually also really hard to work with. Once you have one of these ads, you would expect that it would be really easy to copy the conversation over to another ad. You can’t. You can’t duplicate the ads. You have to duplicate the whole campaign if you want to make a copy of that ad.\nThen I noticed on the left hand rail in Campaign Manager under Assets, there’s a link called Conversations. And I would totally expect that you could just build a whole conversation flow there once, and then anytime you build a conversation ad, you can just link it in. But you can’t. That’s actually only used for click to message ads. They apparently have a thought about wanting to use the same conversation for conversation ads. And I don’t know how much this limitation is going to affect all of you, but for me, whenever I export data from Campaign Manager, I actually can’t differentiate between conversation ads and message ads easily. And this is true with most LinkedIn ad formats I do wish the data said very clearly, this is a lead generation video sponsored content campaign.\nBut if you have the same issue, I have noticed that if you look underneath ad headline, it’ll show sponsored conversation. And aside from actually putting like CA for conversation ad in the campaign name, that’s the only way I’ve been able to figure out how to differentiate these ad formats when you’re looking just at the data.\nSomething I’ve really liked about this messaging format, because it comes across as such a personal kind of touch, LinkedIn also allows us to include what they call macros. These are dynamic insertion, and you can dynamically insert into these messages first name, last name, company name, industry, job title, and that sounds really cool, but I will say I get a lot of these, and as a warning, I would just stick to just first name. And that’s because all the other fields might say something that they don’t identify as. For instance, if you insert job title, it might just be LinkedIn putting the job title that It categorizes their job as, but it’s not the job title that they would have claimed on their profile.\nQuite often, I’ll get some of these where they dynamically insert my company name, and it’ll say, I see you run B2Linked, LinkedIn Ads Performance Agency. And I can tell immediately that it’s not an actual person, that that was just dynamically inserted. But I found if I just say, Hey, first name, that’s a great way to start it off to feel personal. And it doesn’t end up inserting anything that they’re going to say, well, that’s not my job title, or that’s not my industry.\nThere is an additional limitation. Right now you can’t use any of the sponsored messaging ad formats inside of the EU or in the European Union, all because of GDPR. Right when that rolled out, we had a client who was just killing it with message ads in the EU, and when that shut off, it was a sad day for all of us. But listen on, I will have a workaround for you here in just a little bit.\nTo give you a little bit of a history lesson here, conversation ads were actually meant to replace message ads, and message ads actually got sunsetted earlier this year in 2024. They took them away from us. And then after getting some pressure from advertisers who really liked them, they brought them back. And I’ll tell you, I was totally okay with them doing away with message ads, because you can do exactly the same thing with conversation ads that you do with message ads. It didn’t used to be the case. It used to be that conversation ads, the big difference, is they didn’t have a subject line. So it was, whatever the beginning of your message was, like the first 60 characters, that’s what showed up as the subject line. And so conversation ads had a lower open rate than message ads. So of course, advertisers screamed and said, No, we don’t want conversation ads. We want to go back to message ads where we could customize our subject line and get higher open rates. So then LinkedIn gave conversation ads the subject line, and ever since then, I’ve never looked back. I use conversation ads every time that I would want to use a message ad.\nTo have them look indistinguishable from each other, all you have to do is just only put one call to action in a conversation ad, and then it’s just a message ad. Plus, here’s the kicker, the biggest benefit that you get by running conversation ads rather than message ads. Now you can create retargeting audiences from those who either open or click on one of your calls to action. Which you can’t do with message ads. If you’re running message ads, you can’t retarget any of that traffic, but conversation ads, yeah, they can feed your, your middle of funnel or bottom of funnel, whatever retargeting audience you want to create.\nLinkedIn product team. I have a feature request for you. We want to exclude the people that we’ve sent many of these to, and they’ve never taken action, because we don’t want to keep spending money sending them to people who are never going to be interested.\nAlright, let’s talk about the specs and what actually goes into a conversation ad. Because if you’re excited now and you want to go run them, you’re probably going to want to know what goes into it, what you should prepare.\nSo, first off, our subject line, we have 60 characters, that includes spaces, punctuation, all of that. You also get a free banner ad with these. It’s optional, but if you don’t include one, they’re gonna show someone else who might be a competitor. So you might as well include one of these. When they get clicked, it’s free traffic. The only trick is, it only shows up on desktop. So that’s like, what, 20 percent of your, your traffic might end up seeing this banner? But like I said, it’s free, it’s optional, you might as well take advantage of it.\nThen you get your intro message. So this is the first message that you send them, and it can be huge. You can go up to 8,0000 characters. But I won’t recommend going that far. I would recommend keeping at least the first message quite short. I’ve found in many instances that short outperforms long here. You can also include up to 10 emojis in the intro message, before your ad gets disapproved.\nIt will give you options, like being able to do what LinkedIn calls rich text. Things like adding bullets, italics, linking out. But I will say the simpler it looks, the more believable it’s going to be that it came from a person and not a marketing department.\nLike I said, you can insert macros. You can see a little dropdown of the different macro fields. I would just do first name, but you can use any of the fields that you want. You can also add up to five call to action buttons in every step of the message. Those call to action buttons. They can be up to 25 characters and they’re totally customizable. You can write whatever you want. You are limited to 50 buttons in a single conversation. So if on every screen you give people five calls to actions, that’s a lot to build, but also you’re probably going to run out of calls to action.\nIt’s also important to note, if you run these as a lead generation objective, you’re hoping to have lead gen forms make it really easy for people to convert. But you can only associate one lead gen form per conversation. So if you’re giving people lots of different calls to action, it’s important to pick and choose. You can only grab your favorite lead gen form and then the rest have to be links that you send to your website or just show more information. The way that you create these, when you create your campaign, you have to choose one of the objectives that it accepts. So that would be like, probably lead gen or website visit would be my, my favorite. Lead gen, if you’re going to use a lead gen form, website visit, if you’re going to send people to your website, I probably wouldn’t do any other objective other than that. Then when you get down to the ad types, you’ll see conversation ad as one of your options. To make it a little easier, LinkedIn does give you templates that you can start with. So if you create one of the ads from a template, cool. Now you can just kind of edit and customize and it saves you a lot of time having to wrap your head around like, Oh, what do I do to create another screen and, show a result based off of that.\nAs you’re creating and editing the ad, there is also a flowchart option. And that’s a really nice, easy way of seeing your whole conversation visualized, just in case they get really complex.\nSo here’s a limitation. When you go to actually build these, you’re going to want to preview them. You want to see what the ad looks like. It’s actually really hard. You’ll go in to look at the ad, but there’s nothing for LinkedIn to show you because it’s, it’s a whole conglomerated conversation with multiple pages.\nSo instead what you can do, is on the ads edit menu, over to the right, you click on the three dots, and one of those options is to send you a test message. I actually really like this functionality, because no matter what I’m doing with a conversation ad or message ad, I can click that, and immediately I go check my LinkedIn inbox, and I can see a copy of the message, and it’s, if I inserted a field like first name, it’s using my first name, and I can point out any problems very quickly.\nAll right, when you start running these. You’re going to want to know what kind of performance you can expect. Like we mentioned, you do pay on a cost per send basis, and the floor price of what you can pay, it is dynamic. It moves based off of how much competition there is for that audience. I’ve found that usually my range is in the range of like 40 cents to 80 cents per person I send it to. Some I’ve been able to bid all the way down to like 25 cents or 20 cents. So it just depends on how competitive LinkedIn thinks that audience is.\nAs you send these, you’ll see your open rate. And the open rate basically says how interesting is my subject line that people want to open it. The benchmark average is about 55%, so if you’re doing better than 55%, you have a good, compelling message. Once someone opens it, then you obviously want them to click on one of your calls to action. And your click through rate, which LinkedIn will call your click to open rate, LinkedIn It depends on how you’re using it, but it’s usually going to be somewhere between about 3 to 10%. So if you’re doing better than that, great. If you’re doing about the same or maybe even less, okay, there is work to do. One really awesome redeeming factor about conversation ads, though, is that they tend to have really high conversion rates. Much higher than sponsored content or text ads or anything else in the stable.\nI will mention that there is a delay in when you actually want to report on these because you’ll send them to people and I’ve found a delay on average about three days. So you send it to someone, about three days later, you’ll start to see a lot of opens. And then about three days after that, you’ll start to see the clicks rolling in. And because there is this delay, every time you send the ads out, Then it means that when you stop them, if you pause, like, let’s say you pause two weeks in, when you keep watching your stats, they’re going to keep getting better as more of the people that you’ve already paid for are now opening and clicking. So I do like reporting on these after the fact. After they bake out is what I call it. The performance just keeps looking better and better.\nThere is a cool report that you can run for these. If you go to export in campaign manager, and then you choose the option of conversation ad CTA performance, you can end up getting an ad report where it will actually break down the performance of each of your calls to action. So if you have four things you’re asking people to do, you can actually see which one people are clicking on more.\nIf you’re going to stay inside of campaign manager to report on these, you want to choose columns, sponsored messaging. That’s really the only place that you’re going to see the metrics that you really want, which are going to be sends, opens, and clicks.\nNow, since you pay by the send and not by the click, you do want to watch these really closely, because they can get incredibly expensive to the, let’s say, cost per click, if you’re not keeping a close eye on them.\nNow, you know, the option is available on LinkedIn Ads inside the ads edit for rotate ads evenly or optimize for performance. This is the one ad format where I recommend rotate evenly because you actually will get an even A B test out of these. If you have two ads in there, LinkedIn will send one to one ad and then the next one to the other and you have a near 50 50 split. Really good for A B testing.\nWhen you decide who it is that you want to be your sender, you have to send them an invitation. It’s kind of like thought leader ads and they have to accept it. You do have to be a first degree connection to someone to send, which I think is kind of dumb, but okay.\nWhen they accept the permissions to have them show up as a sender, they are actually given limited access to your ads account so that they can see just the campaigns that are using their personality.\nI have noticed that a lot of people will end up not seeing the email from LinkedIn asking them to grant approval. But you, as the ads manager, you can copy the request URL and message them privately and say, Hey, can you make sure you go and accept this?\nWe have gotten some updates here. As of pretty recently, LinkedIn rolled out the ability to bid by maximum delivery. It used to be that we would have to choose what is the bid amount to send, it was all manual, but now LinkedIn added max delivery, which, as we know, it basically means that they can bid as high as they want to, to spend your whole budget.\nI don’t recommend max delivery, unless it’s just a limited test, just to see what it is they bid, but I also wouldn’t be surprised if you bid max delivery, if you’re, if you would be bidding like 60 cents per send, I could totally see LinkedIn bidding like, 1.20 per, and it could get really expensive, really fast.\nI want to give a huge thank you to Anthony Blatner. He’s one of our super fanatics in the fanatics group. He recently mentioned on one of his podcast episodes that he heard LinkedIn changed the frequency cap on conversation ads. It used to be every 30 days someone could receive one of these. Then it got lowered down fairly recently to every 21 days. Now it’s different. It’s a dynamic range of anywhere between 7 to 18 days. If you’re really active in your messaging box, you can probably receive one of these every week. But if you’re not super active, you might be more on the like once every 18 days kind of track.\nLinkedIn also recently released a new not interested button that gets automatically applied to all of your conversations. It’s your, your opening conversation.\nAnd we talked about this on a previous episode, I’m not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing for advertisers, so we’ll have to see once it’s fully rolled out.\nI mentioned before, we do have the ability to re target people who’ve opened or clicked on one of our calls to action, so I think this is really cool. It’s also really important to know that the only people who will ever receive one of these, meaning, that you’ll have to pay for. It’s because they are logged into LinkedIn, looking at their messages.\nSo LinkedIn is not going to charge you to send it to someone who hasn’t logged in, you know, six years.\nSo, I mentioned before that there was a workaround to being able to run these in the European Union, and this is called click to message ads. I didn’t think I was going to like them, but I actually really like these. I just started testing them recently. The way it works is it starts out like a single image ad in the newsfeed. So, there’s no frequency cap, basically. You could show one of these like every 24 hours or maybe even a little bit more often. And when someone interacts with the single image ad, it then takes them to their messaging box where they have a conversation ad from you. So these are kind of cumbersome to build because you have to build a single image ad and a conversation ad all at once. But I do like the way that they get charged because you get the functionality of a conversation ad with that sole focus of having their, their full attention at the price of a newsfeed click. So rather than paying like $25 to $50 per click to cold audiences, you can end up paying, you know, $7, $8 whatever you end up paying for your top of funnel, sponsored content ads.\nAfter running a lot of conversation ads, I’ve got some learnings and I want to share with you what I’ve learned from this.\nFirst of all, I kind of mentioned this before, but try to keep your messages shorter. You want it to feel a little bit more like a text, like a friend texting you, rather than a marketing department trying to dump everything on you.\nAlso, don’t give too many options. I’ve found that two to three options is plenty. If you give people more than that, then they end up going, Oh, I don’t know, there’s so many options, and it’s just easier for them to scroll on to another message than click one of your options.\nAlso, as you’re selecting who the sender is going to be, make it someone believable. Don’t make it like the CEO of your big company, because no one’s going to believe that the CEO cared enough about them to send them a message. You also don’t want to send to someone with like, a sales title, because then they’ll feel like, oh, this is just a sales outreach.\nWarm audiences definitely work better here. You’re gonna pay the same whether someone is warm or cold, but when they’re warm, they’re going to open at a higher rate and click at a higher rate. And that’s going to bring your overall cost per click and cost per conversion way down.\nWe’ve recently had a whole bunch of successes with conversation ads, and so I’ll share some of the things that made these a success.\nOne was we were sending these out to people who were going to be at an event as an invite to meet up or invite them to dinner. And that worked really well. It comes across as like a personal invite, and that’s exactly what you’d want if you were gonna say, Hey, come join me for dinner, or come join one of our, like, a group hosted dinner.\nWe’ve also run quite a few of these as like a demo request, in exchange for a gift card. So, you look qualified, you have the issue that we solve, And if you’re willing to hop on for a demo, we’ll also give you a free gift card. I’m not a huge fan of this call to action. It does work sometimes, so it’s certainly worth trying.\nWe’re also having a lot of success with these in higher ed. So specifically for like, recruiting people for MBA programs.\nIf you’re not already a member of the LinkedIn Ads fanatics community, what are you waiting for?

AJ discusses the platform’s strengths and areas needing improvement to solidify LinkedIn’s place among the top advertising platforms like Google and Meta.\nKey Discussion Points:\nPlatform Tier Classification:\nAJ defines Tier 1 platforms as essential tools that B2B marketers must master, such as Google and Meta, due to their comprehensive features and widespread use.\nLinkedIn is currently on the cusp between Tier 1 and Tier 2, with many key features missing or needing enhancement to reach true Tier 1 status.\nPlatform Generosity:\nAJ introduces the concept of “platform generosity,” explaining that early-stage platforms like Google and Facebook succeeded by offering low costs and high value, attracting widespread use.\nLinkedIn, in contrast, started with higher costs and lacked the generous features that help new advertisers achieve success, which could hinder its growth and perception as a top-tier platform.\nFeature Wishlist for LinkedIn Ads:\nDevice Targeting:\n The ability to target ads based on the device type (mobile vs. desktop) is crucial for optimizing campaigns but is currently missing.\nTime Zone Flexibility:\n AJ argues for the ability to change campaign time zones and schedule ads according to the user’s local time, improving budget efficiency and targeting accuracy.\nHourly Reporting and Scheduling:\n LinkedIn should provide more granular hourly reporting and allow for ad scheduling based on when the audience is most active, enhancing campaign effectiveness.\nDaily Budget Control:\n LinkedIn often overspends on daily budgets, particularly with maximum delivery bidding, which feels like a “cash grab.” More precise control is needed to avoid overspending.\nImproved Audience Matching:\n Enhancements like targeting by LinkedIn profile URLs could significantly improve the match rates for uploaded contact lists.\nCustom Calculated Columns:\n AJ suggests allowing advertisers to create custom calculated metrics within Campaign Manager, eliminating the need for manual calculations in Excel.\nAd Type Transparency:\n LinkedIn should make it easier to identify the ad type within exported reports, helping advertisers better analyze campaign performance.\nExpanded Objectives for Thought Leader Ads:\n AJ advocates for adding more objectives to Thought Leader Ads, including website visits and lead generation, to increase their utility.\nSimplified Duplication and Management of Conversation Ads:\n The current process for creating and duplicating Conversation Ads is cumbersome; LinkedIn could streamline this to make it more user-friendly.\nAdditional Feedback and Community Suggestions:\nAJ shares feedback from the LinkedIn Ads community, including suggestions for better dynamic UTM tracking, a more user-friendly Campaign Manager interface, and dark mode compatibility.\nConclusion:\nThis episode provides a comprehensive evaluation of LinkedIn Ads, highlighting both its potential and the areas where it falls short. For LinkedIn Ads to move firmly into Tier 1 status, it must address these shortcomings, offering advertisers more control, transparency, and tools to optimize their campaigns effectively.\nBy implementing the suggested features and improvements, LinkedIn could significantly enhance its value proposition, attracting more advertisers and solidifying its place as a critical platform for B2B marketers.\n \nShow Transcript\nIs LinkedIn Ads a Tier 2 or a Tier 1 platform? We’re discussing the changes that would make it undeniably a Tier 1 platform on this week’s episode of the LinkedIn Ads Show.\nWelcome to the LinkedIn Ads Show. Here’s your host, AJ Wilcox.\nHey there LinkedIn Ads fanatics. As he said, I’m AJ Wilcox. I’m the host of the weekly podcast, the LinkedIn Ads Show. I’m thrilled to welcome you to the show for advanced B2B marketers. who are looking to evolve their craft and master LinkedIn ads, and of course, achieve true pro status.\nI’m coming off of a week trip to LinkedIn’s Carpinteria campus. It’s near Santa Barbara, California, where I’ve been recording content.\nI had great food and a lot of fun. I’m excited when I’ll be able to share what we shot.\nMany of you may not know this about me, but I’m a huge fan of root beer. I want to try every type of root beer out there. One thing that got me really excited is I went to a store and I found two types of root beer that had been discontinued and I didn’t think I’d ever get to try them.\nI brought 14 bottles home in my suitcase. It was heavy, and I was scared and praying the whole time that they didn’t break. I’m very excited to get them home to my collection.\nAlright, so on to the topic at hand. I talk to members of LinkedIn’s product team quite regularly. And they have a question that they like to ask. If you could wave a magic wand and fix or change anything on the platform, what would it be?\nI’ve hopped on countless calls to give voice of the customer feedback. on many of the things that me and my magic wand would get right to being busy fixing.\nI asked members of our LinkedIn Ads fanatics community, and I put my own list together in hopes that this episode actually becomes a resource for LinkedIn’s product team. I want them to understand what their advertisers want and what they should end up prioritizing in their roadmap.\nSo a question for you, is LinkedIn a tier one platform or tier two? I’ve had some discussions recently with other advertisers about this question. I’ve been in the game long enough that I remember when LinkedIn was a solid Tier 3 platform.\nSo, let me define these tiers a little bit, because this is totally made up by me.\nTier 1 to me would be a platform that you absolutely need to learn to be proficient in your job. And I’m thinking specifically for B2B marketers, because obviously there’s no reason to learn LinkedIn Ads if you are a D2C, or an e commerce marketer. But for business to business, I think LinkedIn has a solid chance at being a Tier 1 platform.\nTier 1 platforms are those that have the features that you’d expect from one of the top platforms in the world. Google and Meta are both squarely Tier 1 platforms. I’m assuming no one here is going to argue with that.\nThen we move down to tier two platforms. They might actually be useful, but they’re not crucial enough to be necessary to the majority of advertisers.\nI’d put Twitter, X ads, Microsoft ads, and even TikTok in this category. They’re good platforms, but with limited usefulness and appeal, especially compared to alternatives that you could use that might be more accessible. Then you’ve got Tier 3 platforms that you probably only would consider if you have a very specific use, or maybe you’ve already maxed out and taken advantage of every other Tier 1 and Tier 2 channel, and you might just consider running a pilot test.\nI’d put Quora ads in this camp, not that they’re bad, just kind of limited in usefulness. It’s also divisive, but I’d also put programmatic advertising in this category too. You can easily get by without them, it’s difficult to get past the learning curve, and, but, when you reach a certain scale, they do become really useful, so, not crapping on on programmatic, just, putting it in its order here.\nIt’s been really exciting to see how quickly LinkedIn’s product team is developing the platform. We’re seeing new features added often enough that I have a hard time keeping up, which I think is a great sign, considering I spend my entire life on LinkedIn ads, but there are many features that LinkedIn still lacks.\nAnd if it could fix, I truly believe that LinkedIn would be cemented as a solid tier one platform.\nThe LinkedIn Ads Show is proudly brought to you by B2Linked.com, the LinkedIn Ads experts.\nB2Linked is the ad agency 100 percent dedicated to LinkedIn ads, and we have been ever since 2014.

I’ve linked to it down in the show notes below if you want to check it out and get really geeky. But basically, they dissect the whole process that LinkedIn Audience Network traffic goes through before you actually get charged for it.\nI won’t claim to be smart enough to actually understand this article, but in a quick run through, it sounds really good. I continue to test land traffic. I’m trying to figure out when it’s useful, when it could help.\nIf you go check out the article, I would love it if you’d send me a message on LinkedIn, let me know what you thought, if you have any ideas, or if it teaches you anything.\nAlso Chandler Quinton, who was episode 122, I interviewed him about how to get incredible video ad performance on LinkedIn. He tagged me in a post that he saw. This was the beginning of pre roll video. So, he found this post from the Wall Street Journal. It had a video that I think was like three minutes long, and he noticed that there was a pre roll ad, which we’ve talked about a little bit before in the news section here, talking about what was gonna come, and trying to understand what it was gonna be like.\nHe messaged me and said, oof, I just saw it, it’s real. There was a pre roll video on this video. The advertiser was the U. S. Postal Service, and it was skippable after a few seconds.\nSo there we go. Chandler has seen pre roll video in the wild. I’m really excited to come across this. I would imagine that this is going to be really good for us as advertisers, especially if we use video ads a lot. But I’m waiting to see, I want to get some experience using it.\nI want to give a shout out to Jacob Juan Carlos Lundy. He gave me a review that I could share for the podcast. And so here we go. He said, &quot;I was part of the LinkedIn Ads fanatics community back in the spring, and I had switched jobs. The new team was hesitant at first about getting me a subscription. But after I received our 150th lead, with a 67 percent decrease in cost per lead, by implementing the things I learned from AJ in the past, they were sold on me joining the LinkedIn Ads fanatics group.&quot;\nJacob’s a growth marketing manager. He’s been advanced certified by us, which is something you can do in the advanced tier of the LinkedIn Ads fanatics community.\nJacob, thanks so much for sharing such an awesome review. I hope you all go out and check out the LinkedIn Ads fanatics group. We have absolute gold happening there. You can check it out by going to fanatics.2linked.com, or if you can’t spell fanatics, just go down into the show notes.\nSo do you have a question, a review or feedback for the show? Message me on LinkedIn. My dms are free and open. Or you could email us here at podcast@b2linked.com. Feel free to attach a link to a voice recording from you, and I would love to actually play you right here on the show.\nAnd let me know if you want me to keep you anonymous or shout out your details. I want to feature you. All right, without further ado, let’s hit it.\nI want to talk about a concept that I call platform generosity. I have a lot of thoughts here. I quote unquote grew up in the world of Google ads and then later in Facebook ads. And I got to watch something really interesting happen. Both of these were very generous platforms, especially when starting. When Google ads first started back when it was AdWords, they set a minimum bid floor of 5 cents per click.\nNow the platform wasn’t amazing in and of itself. Usage and volume weren’t really there. It was growing as a platform. But, because they set the pricing so low, you couldn’t help but have success running Google Ads.\nAnd what ended up happening is, if you were a business owner or a marketer, you would go out and tell all your friends, Hey, I’m killing it on Google, you gotta come try AdWords. Then people would go and speak at events and conferences about how using Google AdWords was the secret weapon. And that word of mouth, that grassroots growth, just took over. Now, Google Ads is quite expensive, depending on which keywords you go after, but it’s routine when I see costs per click that are $20, $30, $50.\nBut you know how Google AdWords got there? It got there by charging a very small amount, letting competition naturally come in, and naturally drive up the pricing. I remember early days of Facebook, where I could get clicks for a third of a cent.\nOf course, the platform was hot garbage back then, it’s gotten a lot better, thank goodness. I squarely call MetaAds a Tier 1 platform. It’s really pushed the envelope.\nBack then, it was not great. But, because the traffic was so cheap, again, you couldn’t help but get good performance from it.\nThese platforms ranked really high on platform generosity, and they only got expensive when they had to be expensive, because there was tons of competition. Everyone wanted to use them, and that’s when prices came up.\nCompare that to LinkedIn Ads. LinkedIn Ads started with a floor of $2 per click. So while I could get clicks for a third of a cent on Facebook, LinkedIn was always charging me at least $2. It’s always been expensive, and that hasn’t changed.\nYou’d think if you were a platform that charged a lot of money, you’d want to really give your advertisers great reasons to stick around. Lots of generosity, lots of help, lots of cool perks. LinkedIn at the time, none of that. The platform was a dumpster fire. They didn’t listen to advertisers. They didn’t have people, at least in mass internally, who’d ever advertise the day in their life. And so right from the beginning, LinkedIn has scored really poorly on platform generosity. But this has continued over and over, especially when you look at the defaults in campaigns.\nWhen you go to set up your first campaign, you have several boxes that are ticked that are not in your favor. They’re going to ruin your performance right out of the gate, and yet LinkedIn is okay with these things being set as defaults. And having new advertisers who don’t know what they’re doing, Leaving those on and messing up their results.\nSo the biggest takeaway that I want you to have from this is LinkedIn should consider being a generous platform, scoring very high on platform generosity and trying to give advertisers as many benefits as possible. So even though costs are higher, we still get thrown a bone every so often.\nLet’s jump into what features would make LinkedIn ads solidly a tier one platform. And I’ll tell you, these are in no certain order. They’re not prioritized in any way. I kind of keep my own notes on if these are like a priority one, priority two, or priority three. So LinkedIn product team, feel free to reach out and I will happily give you this list, but here we go.\nThe first feature is one that is just kind of embarrassing that it’s not here. It’s the ability to target by device. In the last year or so, LinkedIn gave us the ability to break down performance by device, which is great. But obviously, if we can’t actually target by device, there’s nothing useful there. There’s nothing actionable. Honestly, it’s really easy for the ad platform to know what device someone is using. That’s not a technological hurdle that you have to get over. Honestly, I don’t understand why targeting by device, at least the ability to say whether it’s desktop or mobile, why this doesn’t exist yet, it’s embarrassingly still not there.\nAnother one that I think is really important is the ability to change your time zone. So LinkedIn runs entirely off of the UTC time zone, which would make a lot of sense if LinkedIn were a London company, but it’s not. It’s based in San Francisco.\nSo that means the vast majority of advertisers all over the globe LinkedIn’s new day starts at a different time than their day. For me, I’m in the mountain time zone. So, depending on what time of year, it’s either like 6pm or 7pm when LinkedIn’s new day starts. And you can imagine, if you have a small budget on a campaign, let’s say something like $10 or $20 a day, The chances of being able to spend that $10 or $20 from 7pm all the way until, let’s say, 7am the next morning are really high. And there’s no way around it. You are just going to get traffic in the middle of the night, the people who can’t sleep. And it’s not going to be the best traffic you’ve ever gotten.\nNot only do I want to report on the traffic by the client’s time zone, that way all of the traffic actually matches up with their analytics platforms. But I also want the new day to start at midnight in their time zone, not UTC. We’ll end up losing a lot less budget that way.\nNow that goes hand in hand with my next ask, which is scheduling. So again, every other platform on the planet has scheduling. It’s an absolute mystery why LinkedIn hasn’t done this yet, but the ability to say I only want my ads to show during these times. This would be especially powerful on LinkedIn, because every other platform, usage probably stays pretty constant all the way through the day, but LinkedIn has very defined usage pattern. People, you can see very specifically, when people start to come into the office in the morning, you can see a lull when they leave, you can see a little spike at the end of the day after they’ve put kids down to bed or had dinner, it’s pretty intense. So because of those specific usage patterns, scheduling would be super powerful on LinkedIn. Again, pretty embarrassing that it doesn’t exist yet. I don’t know why it doesn’t exist. There are plenty of third parties who’ve now built software to enable you to do it. But honestly, this needs to be something that LinkedIn has internally. And this coming from someone who has built a scheduling tool.\nNow with scheduling, there is a benefit that LinkedIn can provide that no one else could, no third party, and that is the ability to schedule in your prospects times out. So the way this would work, if I’m targeting North America, I have four major time zones happening here. So if I schedule my ads to start, let’s say, 7am, when prospects in New York and on the East Coast wake up, they start clicking through the ads, I start seeing their traffic, but in California, it’s 3am, and we’re not getting any of them. Imagine if LinkedIn had a scheduling tool where if you said, I want it to be 7am, they would schedule those ads only at 7am in Eastern Time, and then as soon as it hit that time in Central, it would also turn on, and all the way through the day. I’m not aware of any other platform out there that has this. If LinkedIn released this, this would be definitely Tier 1 platform status.\nOn the same line of thinking here, It doesn’t make sense to schedule your ads and your campaigns when you don’t know what’s actually happening within those hours of the day. So what I would love to see from LinkedIn, and this is something I’ve asked for before, I want to see hourly reporting. Right now we can break down performance down to the individual day, but we know there are certain hours of the day and certain days of the week that perform better than others. We would need to actually have reporting by hour so we could measure that.\nAll right, different topic here. LinkedIn has a problem staying within your daily budget. It didn’t used to be such a problem, but LinkedIn have over time given themselves more and more allowance to overspend your budget. And we routinely see if you’re bidding by maximum delivery, LinkedIn will just routinely every day overspend your budget by 50%. Help documents say that it’s supposed to underspend on other days to try to even it out, but I don’t know if you’ve seen it. I have not seen it. It just seems to overspend every single day.\nNot only does it make it feel like the platform is not being generous, it feels grabby like it’s trying to grab money out of your pocket that you don’t want to let go of, but it also makes the platform look like it’s not smart enough. Now, I definitely get it if you’re 5 away from hitting your daily budget and you have an 8 bid. Sure, overspending by a click would totally make sense. And then you could always underspend by that much the next day to even it out. Makes a lot of sense. But here’s what I don’t get, when you’re bidding CPM, and this is with maximum delivery, that’s how most are bidding CPM, you are paying by every 1, 000 impressions. That means every 1, 000 impressions that LinkedIn decides to serve, it knows how much it’s going to charge you for each of those. How hard would it be for LinkedIn to actually stop serving ads the second you served an impression that pushed you over your daily budget? It would not be hard. You would have a thousand chances to not overspend that budget. And of course, LinkedIn controls when it serves an impression. So it’s not like it’s a, there’s so many out there. You never know how many clicks are going to come in. If there’s multiple people seeing an impression, no LinkedIn knows every single time it serves an impression. So I feel like there’s no excuse for overspending a CPM bid. It just feels like a cash grab. It’s just one more thing that’s telling me that LinkedIn does not score high on generosity of a platform.\nSeparately, have you ever uploaded a contact list and looked at your measly, like, 20 percent match rate? And then unlike a company list, if you click into it, it won’t give you any sort of feedback that would help you actually up that match rate.\nThis is really problematic, especially because when we upload lists of emails as a contact list, that should let us narrow down on the exact person that matches. But the vast majority of users are logging in with their Gmail, their free email, but then they’re going to sign up for your white paper or whatever on their business email address. So LinkedIn has a huge match rate issue. If what you’re relying on is an email address. But, what if that contact list had a field for someone’s public profile URL?\nWe have this with company upload lists. We have a field where you can put in a company page URL from LinkedIn and those match, no surprise, at 100 percent match rate. So a contact list, if we had a field and we could upload LinkedIn’s profile URLs, that would again give us 100 percent match rate. We wouldn’t have to worry about the email matching problem.\nI also really like to be able to target someone’s individual connections or followers on LinkedIn. Especially if you have something like a thought leader ad, being able to target the followers and connections of that individual could be extremely powerful. Alright, so how do you actually target someone’s connections and followers? Well, there’s an easy way to do this with connections. You have the person go into the back end of their LinkedIn settings, and they can export all of their connections to a CSV. So it takes a little bit of massaging, but you can then upload that CSV back to LinkedIn as a matched audience. And voila, you now have a list that you can use as an audience of their direct connections. But you can’t export your followers.\nAnd this is a problem for someone like me, who, I’m really choosy about who I connect to, so I have something like 9, 000 connections, but I have 40, 000 followers. How powerful would it be if I could target my followers? But I can’t unless I use scraping, which is against LinkedIn’s Terms of Service and endangers my profile. So LinkedIn, how hard would it be to give us the ability to target the connections and followers of a specific user? Even if we had to get permission from that user to be able to do that, this would be an incredibly powerful feature.\nThe next one is in Website Actions. I don’t know how much you guys have used Website Actions for tracking conversions and creating retargeting audiences, but I absolutely love it. It’s so powerful. This ability to say, when someone clicks this button, that’s when they’re submitting a form, and I want you to call that a conversion.\nBut I am having some trouble with website actions, and it really comes down to how often does LinkedIn come back and index, what are the different buttons and links on this page.\nAnd also, when you go in and you select a, the name of a button, it’ll say, used on this page, and three others. But there’s no way to drill down deeper and find out what those other three pages are. That would be so valuable for trying to narrow down if I’m trying to find a specific button on a specific page and I’m not seeing it, wow, how cool would that be?\nSo what I really want here, I want the ability to tell LinkedIn with a button, please go re crawl this page and see if the buttons have changed. Because if you make a change to your website. I’m actually experiencing this right now, where with a client, they’ve changed the website, and I go back every day, waiting for that button to appear, and it hasn’t appeared yet. It’s been over two weeks now. So, maybe website actions takes more than two weeks to re crawl a page, or maybe there’s a problem with the page, and I don’t know, and I can’t go and fix it, because I don’t know what the problem is. So what I would love, if there was some sort of a visual of like, Can I click something and see how LinkedIn’s website actions views the page? That would really help me in troubleshooting. Otherwise, if everything’s up to date and website actions recognizes all your buttons, super powerful, I love the tool.\nNext, I want to be able to create custom calculated columns inside of Campaign Manager. We can rearrange different columns and give ourselves the view that we want. But there are some calculations that I do, that LinkedIn does not do natively, are things I care about, my own metrics, my own calculations, but I can’t get them unless I export my data to Excel and run a calculation there. This would be things like, I love to calculate for video ads, my cost per 50 percent view. I don’t think that would be that hard to just be able to say this field divided by this field plus this field or whatever. , I would just love to see this from LinkedIn.\nOne major weakness in LinkedIn’s reporting is no matter what sort of report that you export, LinkedIn will never give you information about the image that you’re using or the video file that you’re actually playing, other than they’ll tell you like the file’s length.\nI would absolutely love it if LinkedIn would give us the ability to export the name of the image as it was uploaded to LinkedIn or some other signifier, something that we could pull up. and do a VLOOKUP to find.\nAlso inside of reporting, when you generate an ad report, there’s no single column, no single field that tells you what the ad type is that’s being used. Your campaign type field, it will say sponsored update, whether it’s a single image or whether it’s a document. So when I go to audit an account, and if they haven’t put really good nomenclature in the campaign names, I’m looking at it going Geez, I don’t understand, like, what ad type is this? I have to look over to see in the video views column if there’s like a number greater than zero that tells me that it’s a video ad.\nOh good. Now I know that this is a video sponsored content post. I don’t feel like this would be very hard. LinkedIn knows there are, you know, 19 different ad formats and counting.\nNow on to thought leader ads. One major ask that I have for LinkedIn here is I want thought leader ads with additional objectives. Right now, we can only use brand awareness, which is total garbage, or engagement, which is really expensive.\nI especially want thought leader ads with the ability to run as a website visits objective, so I’m only paying for those who click on the link, and I would die for thought leader ads to have a lead generation component.\nNow this recommendation here is more of a plea. LinkedIn, Please, please, please stop charging us for clicks on the See More link. If I’m bidding 10 for a click or more, I do not want to pay 10 for someone to read more of my ad and then keep scrolling. It’s not worth it. It’s absolute garbage. This happens in the lead generation objective, which is crazy because in lead generation, we don’t get charged for clicks on the social pill, like likes and comments, but we do get charged every time someone clicks the See More.\nSame thing with the engagement objective. I realized that a click on See More is what you would call an engagement. But boy, it’s not a valuable enough one for me to say, yeah, I’m willing to pay for that. Most advertisers that I talk to don’t realize that they’re paying for clicks on See More. So please, please, please LinkedIn, stop charging us for those Seymour clicks.\nNow, for those of you advertisers who are running conversation ads, Ah, I love conversation ads. If you listened to the last episode, you’ll know exactly why. For conversations, they’re really manual and really difficult to build.\nNow, what would be really cool is if conversations were like lead gen forms. Hear me out here. You create one lead gen form and you can attach it to any ad, any format you want, pretty much. But conversation ads, you build a conversation ad once, and it lives by itself, and it’s unduplicatable. You can’t do anything with it.\nWhat I would love, we already have conversations in the navigation for using click to message ads. This might already be on the roadmap, but what I would love to see, let’s go into conversations and let’s build a conversation once. Then, when we go to create a conversation ad, we can just say, I want this to be the ad’s name, this to be the sender, and then boom, I’m going to grab this conversation that already exists and attach it to it. And then the kind of, like I mentioned before, please let us duplicate conversation ads. The only way that you can actually duplicate them is by duplicating the campaign, which is a huge pain.\nWhat about dynamic UTM parameters? This is kind of a new feature, so I don’t know how many of you are using it, What I would absolutely love is if the dynamic UTMs would allow you the insertion of something that we actually control at the ad level.\nWe have tons of really valuable fields that you can pass at the campaign level. Things like your campaign name, your campaign ID, your campaign group name, so much valuable stuff. But then at the creative level, if we want to tell what’s the actual ad that’s driving this performance, for the actual creative, the only dynamic parameter that we have is creative ID. Now, this is not an ID that we create, we define, and can say it looks like this, and this is something I’ll recognize.\nNo, it’s a machine generated number that started incrementing from a certain level, and LinkedIn knows what it means on the back end, but it means nothing to us. So if dynamic UTMs could allow us to output our ad name, or some other parameter that we could define That would be amazing. That would give us the ability to use dynamic UTMs and track all the way down to the creative level, not just the campaign level.\nAnd further about dynamic UTMs, what about being able to track on a boosted post of some kind? So a company boosted post or a thought leader ad? These were content that already had a post that had a link. When you turn these into an ad, there’s no way of Editing them and making sure that when that traffic gets to your website, analytics or your CRM can tell that traffic came from this particular campaign and this particular app, the traffic is indistinguishable from organic right now.\nWhat I would absolutely love is, what if our dynamic UTMs could take those links as they go out, even though they were set organically before, and just append tracking parameters to the end of them. It seems super easy, technically, to get away with.\nThis next one is one that I’ve heard a lot, and I actually know LinkedIn is working on this. This is where multiple ad types can run under a single campaign. I can’t tell you how annoying it is when I have to double the number of campaigns in an account just because I want to try a different ad format. I don’t know what the stall is. LinkedIn has been working on this for years. Maybe there are some really heavy technical challenges that are keeping this from coming to fruition. But I hear this from advertisers all the time. This would be huge for us.\nThe next one is also one that I get asked a lot about, and this is a change history. So, every ad platform I’ve ever used has an easily accessible change history. This is where you can click one link and see every change that’s been made to an account, with the timestamps, who made it, all of that.\nNow you can go to your rep and ask them to pull a change history. By the amount of time and effort that it takes, it sure looks like it’s not easy for them to pull. And the results that they get, it’s all in JSON. It’s basically code that you have to decipher and try to figure out what happened.\nChange history is so valuable for advertisers, especially those who work with agencies. Because if you’re an agency that isn’t doing very much, you deserve to be fired. I’m sorry. Companies need to be able to see the change history and audit and know that who they’re entrusting their ad account with is actually making changes, is actually doing some work.\nThis change history already exists. It just needs to be able to be pulled from our side.\nAlright, I’ve talked about platform generosity a lot. This next suggestion I have would be incredible for generosity. This is what I would call best price bidding. So as background, if you use maximum delivery bidding, this is where LinkedIn will bid as high as it needs to on CPM to spend your daily budget and actually now overspending it by 50 percent every day.\nOn the other hand, manual CPC bidding, especially bidding low on it, is the cheaper way to pay for your LinkedIn traffic 90 percent of the time. We’ve talked about this several times on the podcast.\nI’ve figured out that if my landing page click through rate is higher than 1%, then paying by CPM, especially maximum delivery, is usually the cheapest way to pay for that traffic. And if my link click through rate is less than 1%, then bidding low manual CPC bidding is usually the best method.\nThis is the rule of thumb that I’ve put together after analyzing millions of dollars in ad spend, but it’s different for every audience and it’s different for every ad. But of course, LinkedIn knows the exact performance and how that performance changes hour by hour. It knows how it changes ad to ad. It knows how it changes throughout the day. So LinkedIn could definitely dynamically switch bidding models to maximize your budget and get you the lowest costs. Because we do this manually, LinkedIn could do it faster because it’s on the inside, it knows when these shifts happen. The question you would ask is, why would LinkedIn do this if it loses them money? Simple. It’s the long game. When your customers have lots of success on the platform, they’re going to bring more budget, and then they’re going to tell everyone they know, you’re an idiot if you’re not advertising on LinkedIn. This is an absolute game changer for us. And that is the level of conversation that you want happening off of your platform, driving people to come and spend more money, bring their budgets, and become lifelong fans. Boom.\nMy next suggestion should not even have to be a suggestion.\nWhen you go to bid manually, LinkedIn is going to show you a suggested bid and a suggested bid range. And not only are these ranges wild that it suggests, you’ll see recommendations for like a, a $20 to $90 cost per click bid. I’m sorry, if you’re paying $20 to $90 per click, you’re doing something wrong. But LinkedIn will make it look like that’s what everyone else is doing. It makes me feel like these bidding ranges are just pulled out of nowhere. And my recommendation to LinkedIn, these need to be based on historical data. If there’s a campaign that has a $10 per day budget, you do not need to pay $20 to $90 per click to spend that budget. You should be bidding down to like 4 or 5 and get your two clicks for the day. LinkedIn has access to this. It knows what our budget is. It knows the historical performance of our ads. So if I launch an ad that has a 0. 2 percent click through rate in the newsfeed, I know that’s bad. LinkedIn would look at that and say, man, you’re going to have to bid really high to get anyone to actually see these ads. But if LinkedIn can see my historical ad performance, that I routinely have click through rates over 1%,\nI don’t think that’s too much to ask for the suggested bid ranges. In fact, all of the suggested everything inside of a campaign, to actually be based off of your historical performance and your actual performance, not based off of someone else’s average that does not pertain to your ad performance and your budget level.\nAnother thing that would be really cool, you know how we have lead gen forms? That outperformed the forms that are on your website. What if LinkedIn had landing pages that loaded immediately? They were trusted because they stayed on LinkedIn, but they were still customizable by the advertiser. We wouldn’t have to send traffic to a website at all. We could keep everything on LinkedIn. And if the building of these pages and the navigation were easy, were powerful, we wouldn’t have to send traffic anywhere. It’s my understanding that If you use LinkedIn Recruiter, they do have this, and it’s obviously for like posting job positions. But I would love to see this kind of a landing page builder, for all advertisers, not just LinkedIn Recruiter customers.\nYou may have already noticed this, when you go in to look at previews of your ads, some ad formats have a really bad preview experience. Especially, I’m looking at you, text ads. document ads, and sponsored messaging. I want a standard preview experience across all ad formats. That means right from the view of the ad, I want to have a preview button that shows me that ad, no matter what ad type it is, looking exactly as it’s going to look when it’s being served as an ad.\nWhen I export data from LinkedIn, LinkedIn includes columns, but only the columns that are necessary for the ads within it. So, let me give you a scenario here. For a client, if I export the first two weeks of the month, and the last two weeks of the month, and then I want to combine those data sets to do some sort of an analysis on, what I’ve found that’s really annoying is that if I were running a different ad type in the first half of the month compared to the last half, my columns are going to be different, they’re going to have changed order, and they’re going to be different altogether.\nWhat I would love is for the ability to export all columns, all the time in the same order. So no matter what I combine, it’s going to be easy to combine into Excel.\nNow, I know you’ve experienced this. When you go to get permissions to an account, it’s really difficult. Not only do you have to know where and how to get permissions to the ad account, but then if you ever want to create your own ad, you have to get permissions to the company page. And there’s so many different kinds of permissions. It’s mind boggling to understand. It takes basically a college degree to understand what the permissions do and what you actually need. I would love if we had really good permissioning where it doesn’t matter if you’re connected to someone or not, you could always send them a request to use their post as a thought leader permissioning If you have their email address, or if you have their profile URL. And that also doesn’t matter when you’re wanting to choose someone as a sender for your sponsored messaging ads.\nWe should have simple permissions. A single place to grant someone access to both the company and the ad account together. Make it really easy to give them the permissions they need to be advertising. And also to make it really easy to get the permission from people to use their likeness or their posts.\nA somewhat recent change that LinkedIn made is in order to be granted super admin rights to a company page, And You have to follow the page. That is really, really annoying, especially as an agency, when I get a message from my team saying, Hey, can you go follow this page? The client is trying to give you access. LinkedIn, please don’t make us do things like follow the company’s page before we can get rights. Just make it so we can invite the right person.\nHave you ever used the A B testing feature inside of Campaign Manager? No, me neither. What happens is it makes you create ads in separate campaigns. That is not an actual A B test. That is two separate audiences in LinkedIn’s eyes with two separate ads. They’re both going to get their own relevancy scores.\nThey’re both going to be treated differently in the auction. LinkedIn, please allow us to create an A B test where two ads go into a single campaign. And please let us actually serve them equally. That’s going to be a way better test.\nNow, this suggestion is one that’s been in beta for a while. So I know we’re eventually going to get it, but this is the connection between sales navigator and campaign manager. We want our sales teams to be able to tag people and send them to create a dynamic audience to be able to either advertise to or exclude from our ads.\nAnd this is all within the LinkedIn universe. It makes perfect sense. This should be so easy, but it’s been in beta now for probably over nine months. This is a feature I want. I want you to break through the walls and get us this feature.\nMy next wishlist item here is for simpler boosting of thought leader ads.\nRight now, you have to choose the perfect cocktail of things in a campaign to make it so you can actually boost your post as a thought leader ad. You need to get one of the two objectives right, and then you need to make sure you choose the exact ad type. And only then will your post actually show up as being eligible.\nWhat I want to see is a wizard where you can start from the post that you want to boost and then LinkedIn will walk you through. Here are your choice of objectives. Here are your choice of ad formats to get there. This would make the process of sponsoring a thought leader ad dead simple.\nA major annoyance that I have is that when I upload lists or create retargeting audiences, if they don’t actually get attached to a live campaign within 30 days, they go inactive. This is not a problem for engagement retargeting lists, like people who watched 50 percent of a, of a video ad. Okay, no big deal. You can always get that back. But if this is a website visits retargeting list, when that audience goes archived, that list is no longer building. LinkedIn has forgotten about it, and if you go to restart it, it starts from ground zero.\nPlease, LinkedIn, even if you have to bug us by asking us, like, Hey, are you still planning on using this list? Should we keep it active? Yes. Please just give us the option so that these aren’t going inactive and we’re losing valuable audiences.\nSomething else going way back. I don’t know how many of you have been advertising on LinkedIn long enough to remember the Bizzo acquisition. Back when LinkedIn bought Bizzo, they had a product called LinkedIn Lead Accelerator. The whole value behind it was creating very simple build sequences. And the major value that you had with the LinkedIn Lead Accelerator, or LLA, was that you could build sequences of ads. So, show someone this first, and then after they interact with it, show them this, and then show them this.\nWe still build those kind of funnels here at B2Linked, but it’s incredibly manual. We have to build so many different retargeting audiences and remember to go and exclude them at certain stages of the funnel and target them at others. It’s a huge pain. LinkedIn, you already created the technology in LinkedIn Lead Accelerator. Bring that technology back. Make it dead simple to build funnel sequences. We would love it.\nAnd LinkedIn, please stop making the worst performing options defaults. These are things like in the geographic targeting leaving it as a Recent or permanent just make that permanent. Please turn off LinkedIn Audience Expansion by default. Please don’t suggest LinkedIn Audience Network by default. That’s a more advanced option. Let someone test into that. Don’t make maximum delivery the default option. Or if you do, don’t hide the manual CPC option behind an option that says click for more options just to reveal one.\nIf you can help newer advertisers have success, Not make mistakes when they launch their campaigns. There are so many more who are going to come back with budget again next month and say, we had success. We have more budget. This is going to be better for you and for all of us advertisers.\nSomething other ad platforms have is the ability to annotate inside the account, putting notes in the account really easily to see when certain things happen. It would be super easy, I think, to add the ability to annotate and say on this date, these ads launched, on this date, we made a bidding change, whatever that is, we would love something simple just to be able to attach notes inside of your account.\nNow, if you’ve run conversation ads, you know, how effortless it is to go and choose your calls to action because you just have to stay under, I think it’s 25 characters. And you can make that call to action, whatever you want. But when you run a different ad format, you have to use one of the preset calls to action. How hard would it be to let us customize all of the calls to action buttons, just like you can on conversation ads?\nFor advertisers who are using LinkedIn’s audience network. What I would love, and I don’t feel like this is a big ask is I want pacing. What you’ll notice if you’re bidding decently high on a LinkedIn audience network campaign. You can spend your whole day’s budget in 10 or 20 minutes. LinkedIn has pacing algorithms right on LinkedIn. It should have them on the audience network as well. We should be able to pace it out and say, Let my ads show all day long. And you shouldn’t have to control that by bidding super low. Because we have noticed when we bid really low on LAN, we do get worse quality.\nI mentioned before how maximum delivery bidding is the most expensive way to pay for your traffic 90 percent of the time, and manual was the cheapest 90 percent of the time. And the whole reason that we have to have these kinds of heuristics, is because LinkedIn programmed originally the cost per impression to not match the cost per click, like they do on other platforms.\nSo for instance, early days on Google, it didn’t matter whether you said I want to pay by the click or by the impression, if you had an ad that was performing about average, no matter which of those options you chose, you would pay about the same price.\nLinkedIn though, it’s weighted against cost per impression bidding. And maximum delivery bidding is the easiest bid to choose, but by choosing it, you end up getting punished by paying too much.\nI’ve got a YouTube video explaining all the math behind this, but basically LinkedIn, if you could have your cost per impression and your cost per click be equal, the average click through rate, boom, we’d be right there at a tier one platform. When we are bidding manual\nWhen we are bidding manual CPC, you’ll notice that little box that says, allow bid adjustment for high value clicks. Thanks. It doesn’t seem like we’re actually getting higher value clicks. It just looks like my CPC is being increased by 50%. I don’t know if there’s an adjustment that needs to be made there, or maybe you’re a little bit more choosy about which clicks you call high value, but either way, it doesn’t look like it’s working.\nI love the Saved Audiences feature. When I build an audience inside of Campaign Manager, I’ll save it and be able to use that for all of posterity. But the challenge that we have is that when you use a saved audience, it totally overwrites everything within that campaign. What I would love to do is create a saved audience of the standard exclusions that I want to have across my campaigns.\nMaybe this is excluding current customers and competitors. I want to be able to apply that saved audience to a campaign, and not have it overwrite all of the job titles and all of the skills that I’ve already selected for that campaign. This seems like it should be an easy option to add, Let me create saved audiences and then choose to append rather than replace.\nCurrently some of our clients are having a challenge getting people who fill out lead gen forms to actually book an appointment on a sales reps calendar. I would love it if there was a calendar integration within lead gen form. So imagine someone fills out the form and right within the form itself, you could have a calendar picker. Maybe it integrates with something like HubSpot or Calendly, whatever that is. I would love it if they could choose a date right within the form while they’re thinking about it, because it can be really difficult to get someone to fill out the form, then go check their email, click on a Calendly link, and then go and book.\nNow I’ve mentioned Anthony Blatner a whole bunch of times on this podcast. He’s a super fanatic in the fanatics community. He’s also the host of the LinkedIn Ads Radio Podcast. So if you haven’t checked that out yet, I highly recommend it. But he gave me some really thoughtful improvements that I wanted to share. As I read these, I was like, yes, I need to include these and I need to give you credit.\nHe said dynamic UTMs should not only be applied to the links, but also to the links in the body copy. This seems like a total no brainer. No matter what link leaves that post, it should contain the dynamic UTMs.\nHe also said that in Campaign Manager, the columns are so wide and it makes it really hard to see everything you want to see on your screen. He said make them resizable and make the column headers wrap so that we can have a lot more data on the screen all at once. He also suggested better filtering for ads and campaigns. On Facebook and Google, you can do something like contains or does not contain and add several filters. But on LinkedIn, we only can filter by what it does have. That would make it extra powerful. He mentioned how bulk actions doesn’t work with many ad types. So it’s kind of useless unless you’re already working with just a certain kind of ad type that is supported. He suggested a mobile app or at least a mobile friendlier version of campaign manager so that we can manage ads on the go. I love this idea.\nHe also said, dark mode is a must. For those of us who have LinkedIn set up as dark mode, we want LinkedIn ads to be dark mode as well.\nSo thank you to Anthony Blatner for those awesome ideas. And thanks for being an awesome member of our LinkedIn ads fanatics community.\nNow, if you guys are not part of the LinkedIn Ads fanatics community, you need to get there.

We’re talking about brand lift studies on this week’s episode of the LinkedIn Ads Show\nWelcome to the LinkedIn Ads Show. Here’s your host, AJ Wilcox.\nHey, they’re LinkedIn Ads fanatics. As he said, I’m AJ Wilcox. I’m the host of the weekly podcast, the LinkedIn ads show. And I’m thrilled to welcome you to the show for advanced B2B marketers who want to evolve their craft and master LinkedIn Ads and of course achieve true pro status.\nMany advertisers that I speak to don’t know that LinkedIn offers these free brand lift studies. I’ve gotten to use them on several occasions and I really like them. Today we’re talking about what they are, how to get access, and what you can expect from them.\nThe LinkedIn Ads Show is proudly brought to you by B2Linked.com, the LinkedIn Ads experts.\nThat’s right, B2Linked is the ad agency 100 percent dedicated to LinkedIn ads. And we have been ever since 2014, you know, back before it was cool. We build a custom strategy for every account we work with. You get to work directly with me and my local team, and you won’t get a cookie header approach or any sort of standard account template from us.\nPlus, over the course of 150 million spent, I got to develop the strategies that allow us to get the lowest costs possible from LinkedIn. We always save our clients more than we charge. So it’s kind of like getting the best in the biz for free. So if you’d like to explore partnering with us for your LinkedIn Ads, schedule your free discovery call today at b2linked.com/discovery.\nFirst off in the news, so many of the platforms out there are heavily influenced right now and through the rest of the year, pretty much by political advertising. What’s so interesting is that because LinkedIn doesn’t allow political ads on its network, we are pretty much immune to this.\nSo just in case you’ve been worried about, Hey, what’s going to happen all the way up through November, if I’m advertising in the U S no worries, political ads, aren’t going to drive our CPMs up.\nHere’s a really interesting change. As of August, all monthly invoicing customers have to have LinkedIn’s business manager set up. So to me, that says, if you are hoping to ever be on invoicing, just a heads up, you’re going to need to get your permissions transferred over to business manager, rather than managing them right within your campaign manager. And don’t worry, if this impacts you, you will have already received an email from LinkedIn, so no big deal there. And honestly, I used to hate business manager. Every time I saw a client account come in that used it, I would go, oh, this sucks. But it’s actually gotten really good and I haven’t seen nearly as many issues with it. So I’m all for it.\nFor those of you who are not already on business manager, it does require that everyone who has access has two step verification set up on their LinkedIn account. That can be a little bit of a hurdle for some companies. So I wanted to throw that out there just as you’re considering it.\nAlso a heads up that newsletter ads are now available to all advertisers, both from companies and from individuals. Now, you might be a member of my personal newsletter. This is the B2Linked one. It comes as me. So as we’ve started advertising our own newsletter, we’ve realized that it has to come from me personally as a thought leader ad. If we had set it up as B2Linked is the one sending out the newsletter, then it would have just been like a company boosted post. The one thing I really like about the company boosted post way of promoting a newsletter is, you know, it comes from the company, so it’s not quite as engaging as if it comes from a person. But, you can actually attach those to lead gen forms, and I love the idea of, when someone signs up to your newsletter, you can have a lead gen form collecting their information, so you can actually know, who is it, who are members of my, my newsletter, which, if it’s a personal newsletter, like mine is, And it’s a thought leader ad to promote it. It means that we can’t use a lead gen form. Oh, well, hopefully in the future.\nAlright, do you have a question, a review or feedback for the show? Please message me on LinkedIn. My DMs are free and they’re open. And you can also always email us at podcast@b2linked. com. If you attach a link to a voice recording, then I’ll play them right here on the show. Just make sure you let me know if you want me to keep you anonymous or shout you out.\nWith that being said, let’s hit it. We’re talking about Brand Lift Studies. First of all, we have to ask, what are they?\nThese are free marketing research in the form of Brand Lift Studies that are provided by LinkedIn. And that is, they are free, okay. If you have a high enough budget. We’ll get into that again here in a few minutes. You may have already noticed these, but if you go in the left sidebar navigation under the word test, you’ll see two different kinds of tests you can create. If you click create test and then brand lift test, that enables these. Now, although it is free to run a brand lift test, requires quite a bit of budget. So you could arguably say it’s not really free. You have to be budgeted to spend at least $60,000 in the next 90 days so that you can ask a single question. Now if you have extra high budgets, you’re in the $90,000 range for the next three months, you can ask two questions. And if you are crazy high in budgets for every additional $45,000 that you add on to your 90 day budget, you can ask an additional question all the way up to six total questions for the quarter.\nSo yeah, despite these actually being free, you do need to spend a considerable amount on LinkedIn Ads in order to get the access for free.\nSo how do they work? What LinkedIn does is it takes your total target audiences in your account and it breaks them up into two groups. One is a test group and one is a control group. As you start spending at the beginning of your test, LinkedIn starts showing these poll questions that show up in the news feed to these members of your audience. And it starts collecting their responses. Then towards the end of your 90 day test, LinkedIn shows them again to the same audiences, and then it gets to measure the lift or drag.\nThe reason this works is that LinkedIn is giving these audiences 90 days of potentially getting to see your ads, and then being able to give feedback on how well your ads are working at making an impression to those audiences.\nThere are 11 total questions that you can choose between. I’ll run you through the content of each one and probably the ones that I would recommend that you run.\nFirst option is top of mind awareness. This is where you can ask what brand comes to mind when you think of X category, and you can provide your company name along with four others. And you’re hoping that over this 90 days, because they’ve seen your ads, they’re much more likely to click your brand over one of your competitors.\nThe next one is called Aided Awareness. This is where it just simply asks, Have you heard of X brand or product? And they can click a button that says yes, no, or not sure.\nThe next one is Product Consideration. This is where it asks, How likely are you to consider X brand or product for your next purchase? And they have five options all the way from very likely to very unlikely.\nThe next one is brand familiarity, where you get to ask, how familiar are you with this brand or product? And it goes all the way from very familiar to not at all familiar.\nAnother one for brand. This one is brand favorability. How favorably do you view X brand or product? And the answers go all the way from very favorable to very unfavorable.\nThen there’s one specifically about ad recall. Do you recall seeing a digital ad for X brand or product? And there’s yes, no, or unsure.\nThen you have recommendation. How likely are you to recommend X product or brand to someone else? And it goes all the way from very likely to very unlikely.\nAnd that’s all the questions specifically about your brand or your products. And then, of course, LinkedIn being LinkedIn, they have a whole bunch specifically about your brand as an employer.\nThere’s employer consideration, saying, if you were looking for a job, how likely would you be to consider X brand.\nThere’s employer favorability. How favorably do you view this brand as an employer?\nAnd there’s the employer recommendation. How likely would you be to recommend X brand as an employer to your friend or colleague? So this is obviously great for those advertisers who are specifically all about recruiting.\nSo as you run these tests over the next 90 days, you’ll want to know what the output is going to look like. For each test that you run, it’ll tell you the number of responses that you got from your control group, and the number of responses from your test group. It also lets you know the statistical strength, how strongly that your lift or drag is backed up by the data. I recently ran a three test study for a client, and it was really interesting across the board.\nOne had a very strong statistical strength, one had a very weak statistical strength, and one just said weak. And from my experience on LinkedIn, this is pretty odd to have two show up as not being very strong, especially because we did spend the entire budget. But, who knows, but your mileage may vary.\nThen it gives you your relative brand lift. And this is a percentage. LinkedIn says that it calculates this by subtracting the control groups desired favorable response from the test group’s desired response. And then it divides that result by the control group’s desired response. Basically it’s saying, what is your brand lift if you take your control group away.\nIn the most recent three tests that I ran, one had a 148 percent relative brand lift. Sounds great. Another had a lift of 7%, and then the third, strangely enough, had a drag of 30%.\nAnd that is strange to have a drag. I’ll tell you about that one here in a couple minutes.\nThe next stat that they give us is your absolute brand lift in percentage points. LinkedIn says it calculates this by subtracting the control group’s desirable response rate from the test group’s desirable response rate. This simply shows you the difference in your responses, whether someone was shown your ads versus not.\nAnd the last stat it gives you is your estimated total lift. Which is the estimated total number of people in your target audience who would respond favorably to your question. So maybe only a few hundred people may have answered favorably on your survey, but it’s like, if you could get this in front of everyone in your audience, here’s about how many people you could expect to respond.\nYou can also drill into the responses to see breakdowns by job function, by seniority, by industry, and by company size for each of your tests.\nSo in this most recent study, the findings were really interesting.\nI mentioned that two of the tests showed a significant lift, which is great. It’s exactly what you’d expect from something like this. But one showed a significant drag. The question was product consideration. How likely are you to consider the brand for your next purchase? As I was investigating why in the world did this show a drag, it decreased for this brand, I found that all the other job functions showed an overwhelming increase, but one. And that’s IT, or information technology. My reasoning here is that IT people are pretty salty, they hate advertising in all of its varieties in general, And they’re much more likely to answer a survey in a way that punishes an advertiser. So I’m going to guess that if you’re running one of these brand lift studies, it’s pretty unlikely that you’ll see the same thing we did with one of these tests, which is a drag. More often than not, it’s just going to show you a net increase. Unless your target audience happens to be heavy in IT people, then I would absolutely love to hear from you.\nSo when you go to actually set these up, a little bit of work in terms of like filling out the questions for the survey, but it’s there’s really not bad. You might ask, is it worth doing it if it takes 15 to 20 minutes to set this up? I definitely wouldn’t suggest spending more than you’re already planning on spending just because you want to get access to these free brand lift tests. But if you’re already spending at least $60,000 per quarter, then why not? The feedback that you get from the data is really great, and at the very least, you have LinkedIn showing a bunch of polls mentioning your brand or product for free, so you really can’t go wrong.\nIf you’re not already a member of the LinkedIn Ads fanatics community, what are you waiting for? Go to fanatics.b2linked.com. For a very low subscription cost, you get access to all four of our courses that take you from absolute beginner to LinkedIn Ads hero. Plus you’re in the community.

I’m thrilled to welcome you to the show for advanced B2B marketers who want to evolve and master LinkedIn Ads and achieve true pro status.\nThe topic of this week’s episode is LinkedIn’s new website actions functionality. Like I said in the teaser, it’s great for us as marketers and no other platform that I’m aware of has a way to make setting up conversions so easy.\nI’ll share what makes it so groundbreaking right after the short break.\nThe LinkedIn Ads Show is proudly brought to you by B2Linked.com, the LinkedIn Ads experts.\nB2Linked is the ad agency 100 percent dedicated to LinkedIn Ads. And we have been back since 2014. You know, before it was cool.\nWe build a custom strategy for every account we work with. You get to work directly with me and my local team. You won’t get any sort of cookie cutter approach or standard account template from us. Plus with the strategies we’ve developed and our mastery of the platform, we save our clients way more than we charge. So it’s kind of like getting the best in the biz for free. If you want to explore partnering with us for your LinkedIn ads, schedule your free discovery call with me today at b2linked.com/discovery.\nFirst off in the news, I’m speaking at the Inbound Conference this week. So by the time you hear this episode, I will have already presented, but if you’re there, I hope we got to chat after the session was over.\nSomething really cool I noticed this week, many of you might know, but LinkedIn has a partnership with the data provider called Axiom, and it used to be really difficult. You would have to ask your LinkedIn rep to add an Axiom audience into your campaign. And then they would go to Axiom, have it added, and then by the time you got the audience added to your campaign, now you can’t do anything with it. If you want to remove it, you have to ask your rep to do it. So they’re really inflexible. What I love about these Axiom audiences though, is you get access to the kinds of data that LinkedIn just doesn’t have. A lot of it’s financial ability to target. So for instance, if I want to target just people who have a high household income or a high home value, or live in certain zip codes, or drive a certain car, lots of those kinds of things are axiom audiences that LinkedIn can pull in.\nAlright, so what I noticed this week is that Axiom audiences are now loaded into your audiences under plan. And so now you can use them however you want. You can add them to as many campaigns as you want. You can add them as exclusions. The world is really your oyster at this point.\nSo those of you who use Axiom’s audiences often, I’m sure you’re going to find this to be quite a treat. All right, do you have a question, a review, or feedback for the show? Message me on LinkedIn. My DMs are open and they’re free. Or you can always email us at podcast@b2linked. com. You can attach a link to a voice recording from you, and I’ll play it right here on the show. I’m always happy to keep you anonymous, or I can shout out your details as well.\nI want to read a recent review that was left on Apple Podcasts. It says, &quot;Invaluable resource, five stars. This podcast is the best resource on LinkedIn ads available online. I want to highlight the most important things for those of you who, like me, deal with digital marketing on LinkedIn. AJ’s advice and suggestions really work. They allowed me to save a lot of money and obtain results that I believe would have taken me months, if not years, without AJ’s precious advice. Bravo.&quot;\nAlright, this was left by Pelpa78 from Italy. Pelpa, I don’t know who you are. Let me know if you want me to shout you out, but I really appreciate the review. It warms my heart. Nothing makes me happier than knowing that someone is taking this advice, they’re putting it to work, and it’s saving them money and getting better performance.\nAs always, I want to feature you. So please go to Apple podcasts, leave us a review, and I’d love to shout you out. All right. Without further ado, let’s hit it.\nBack in 2022, LinkedIn announced the acquisition of an Israeli company called Oribi. O R I B I. The official announcement from LinkedIn said that the acquisition of Aribi will accelerate our marketing attribution capabilities and establish a new LinkedIn office in Israel.\nI didn’t think much of it at the time, but then at the beginning of 2024, A new product came out that I got really excited about called Website Actions.\nI didn’t realize it, but Website Actions is a direct result of the Oribi acquisition. And it’s awesome. Let me paint the picture for you on why it’s so awesome. So whether you advertise on LinkedIn, Google, or Meta, If you want to track a conversion, you’ve got a couple of options. Number one, and this is my preferred way, when someone fills out a form, you can then redirect them to a thank you page. You then make sure you install the tracking pixel on that page, and then you set the address of that page, so that when that page loads, LinkedIn counts that as a conversion. I’ve recommended this for years and years, because it’s so easy to troubleshoot, and it doesn’t require much technical knowledge at all. Most marketers can do this.\nBut I remember five ish years ago, when I encountered my first developer, who said, Oh, we don’t want to redirect to a thank you page. That’s a bad experience to redirect to a new page. So instead, once the form’s submitted, the URL is going to stay the same, and we’re just going to pop up a conversion message with JavaScript AJAX saying, Thanks, we’ll get back to you.\nIf this is the case, it’s so much harder to set up conversion tracking, but it’s not impossible. What you have to do, you have to get your developer to attach a piece of JavaScript code to execute when that button is pressed. And then the ad network will give you a little snippet of, I think it’s HTML, that the JavaScript will then fire.\nMost don’t do this actually inside the HTML of the page. Most end up doing it with a tag manager solution, like Google Tag Manager, because it is easier than manually coding the conversion into the button’s code in the HTML. But since I’m no JavaScript developer, that was never something I figured out how to do. I hated how difficult it was to troubleshoot if a conversion wasn’t working.\nWhen a client said, our developer said this is good to go, I would just have to sit back and cross my fingers and hope, and watch, wait for a conversion to actually show up in the account. And if it doesn’t fire for a while, then you and your developer are kind of stuck changing stuff and hoping that it works next time. Really annoying.\nWell, I’m happy to report that this is a challenge of the past for LinkedIn advertisers. With website actions, attaching conversions to a button press is super easy and it requires no coding whatsoever. How it works is you first have the LinkedIn insight tag installed on the page of the website that has the form that you want to track. LinkedIn’s website actions inspects the page behind the scenes. And it finds the various buttons and links on the page so that it knows when they’re pressed. Then you, the advertiser, you can go in and set up a conversion. And then Website Actions just shows you the names of all the buttons. You select the box of the button name and boom, you’ve got a conversion. It’s really straightforward.\nThis same technology can be used for creating retargeting audiences.\nSo you can create a retargeting audience of anyone who clicked a specific link or pressed a specific button.\nAll right. If you want to follow along, this is how it works for conversion tracking inside of campaign manager, you go to analyze in the left hand menu. You click conversion tracking. And then create conversion. The type of conversion here is an insight tag conversion. You follow the same steps you always do when you create a conversion. You give it a name, you specify what kind of a conversion event it is, you set the time frame, and choose your attribution model. By the way, I always suggest the attribution model called Last Touch, Last Campaign.\nEven though the default is something different. The default is Last Touch Each campaign. The reason I don’t like Last Touch Each campaign is that it will double count your conversions, and it’ll actually overstate your actual performance. For me as an agency, I’m always super embarrassed if I report a certain number of conversions, and the client looks in their CRM and says, Oh, we didn’t have that many. It makes me look dumb or like I was trying to pull the wool over their eyes. So I would much prefer it only to count the conversion to the campaign that last touched it. All right, so you hit next, and this is where the website actions actually kicks in. The Website Actions tab appears with two categories underneath it. There’s one for Buttons, and there’s one for Pages. Now, Buttons is what I use the most. This is where you select the name of the button or the link on the page that you want to be your conversion. If you select Pages, it’ll show you a list of all of the pages on your site that the Insight tag’s installed on.\nIf you select a page, it counts any visit to that page as a conversion. So this is best used if you’re actually tagging a thank you page.\nIt’s important to note that when you very first go to set up the conversion, over to the right, you’ll see a drop down with all of the different domains that LinkedIn sees using your tag.\nSo let’s say you’ve attached your tag to your website and then maybe a landing pages product and then maybe something like your Calendly has it. You can there, select the domain for where the button actually is that you want to track and you can set up conversions, on different web domains as well.\nAlright, so one mistake that I made, and I’m actually really embarrassed about it, I thought that if you selected a button. And then flipped over and select the page that the button was on that it would filter. It would act as an and, and it would only count the button presses on that specific page as a conversion.\nThat’s not the case at all as it turns out. What it does is it counts any visit to the page that you selected as a conversion. And then if there were any button presses on that button, it just adds it into the same bucket. Totally not helpful.\nWhat you want to do instead, if you want to actually just track a specific button on a specific page, you select the button first, and then on the next page, you can click add filters, and then you can click the radio button for track only on specific pages, then you can add the page in that you want it to filter for. When you do this, you have a few different options for how to match that page.\nThere’s one called contains. There’s one called starts with, and there’s one called equals. I really like to use contains, and then I give it some string that is only in the URL of that page and no other pages. And I like contains or starts with. Because if you have different tracking parameters, like UTMs, that are on the end of the URL, if you selected equals, it won’t count the conversion because it looks at the entire URL and goes, Oh, that’s not what they supplied.\nAnd of course, as you know, tracking with UTMs and other tracking parameters is super important. You don’t want to give up on that.\nIf you’re counting a submit button that submits a form, Don’t forget to click the box at the bottom that says track only buttons that submit a form. I’m not totally certain what this button actually does, but I think what it’s doing is in case there’s another button or link with the same name, or maybe someone attempts to submit the form but they don’t have all the fields filled in, it won’t actually count it as a conversion until it knows that the form actually submitted.\nThen on the next page, you can select the campaigns that you want to attach this conversion to. Which is by far the easiest way if you have a lot of campaigns But if you don’t have a lot of campaigns or you’re gonna be creating the campaigns later You can always go into each campaign and select the conversion manually later.\nSo that’s the flow for creating conversions. But if you want to create retargeting audiences, it’s very much the same, but just in a different area inside of campaign manager, you go to plan. audiences, and then create audience. This is a matched audience and it’s specifically on the website. Then you’ll follow the same flow that we just went through to define what the action is that someone takes to then qualify them to be a part of your retargeting audience.\nThis is very cool functionality. And I’m actually really impressed that LinkedIn has baked this in when to my knowledge, Google and meta advertisers still need to fire these JavaScript conversions the old fashioned way. Congratulations to LinkedIn for having this awesome functionality and having it first.\nBecause as we know, LinkedIn is oftentimes behind the other platform.\nNow is website actions all sunshine and rainbows? Well, as we know, nothing in marketing technology ever is. There are some limitations. Let’s say that you launch a new web page, or you change one and the button name changes. Now you go in to edit your conversion to choose the new button name, but it still looks the same, it hasn’t updated. I’ve seen this happen several times, and LinkedIn’s help article says that website actions updates every 24 hours. But sometimes I find myself waiting much longer than that. I’ve even had some HubSpot forms that LinkedIn’s website actions never recognizes the button. And I still don’t know why that would be the case. HubSpot and LinkedIn are really good partners. So if any of you listeners have any insights into this or have a workaround, please reach out to me. I’d love to share it. I’ve also noticed that there’s a bug that I see pretty much every day, and I keep hoping that it’s going to get fixed. When I edit an existing website actions conversion about half the time the website action buttons and pages load but my selection doesn’t appear so it looks like the conversion tracking isn’t actually tracking anything. But then I hit the refresh button on the page and then the checkbox with my previous selection does pop up\nSo if you’re finding the same thing the refresh button is your best friend\nThe promise of getting to use website actions for retargeting is super compelling, but I have found it quite limited in practice. Remember, website actions is still website retargeting down at the basics. And that means it’s 100 percent reliant on the cookie still being in your prospect’s browser for when they come back to LinkedIn. Or when they land on a LinkedIn audience network partner page, so they can then be shown a retargeting ad.\nWith all the browsers war on cookies. This is already super limited. Plus we still need at least 300 people in an audience to be able to run a retargeting campaign on LinkedIn. And it can take a long time to get enough people to click that button with their browser cookies enabled so that you can have a large enough audience to be useful. It would be infinitely more useful if it was like LinkedIn’s other retargeting that we call engagement retargeting. Where LinkedIn remembers the identity of that user, it remembers that it was there, and logs it in LinkedIn. So not only would you not need cookies for it to know that that person belongs in the retargeting audience, but then that audience would also build in arrears if you set this audience up after the fact. Of course, I don’t know if that’s even possible.\nI mentioned a couple wishlist items back on episode 146 about my wishlists for LinkedIn. That we’re all about website actions. First off, I wish that we could see the page, how website action sees it somehow. Maybe there’s like a portal button you can push where it lets you view your site.\nEvery so often, I’ll see that the button has a different name than what Website Actions shows it as, and I never know, does that mean it’s tracking a different link, and it just doesn’t see that button? I don’t know. I wish we could actually see the page the way that Website Actions sees it.\nI also wish that we could ask Website Actions to specifically update a certain page or give it a page to check.\nThat way, when we launch a new webpage or a redesign or something, we could request it and hopefully have it within a few hours.\nHave you used website actions to track conversions in a really useful way or have you found any other limitations that I didn’t mention?

Here’s your host, AJ Wilcox.\nHey hey, hey there, LinkedIn Ads fanatics. As he said, I’m AJ Wilcox, and I’m the host of the weekly podcast, The LinkedIn Ads Show. I’m thrilled to welcome you to the show for advanced B2B marketers that want to evolve and master their craft and become true pros at LinkedIn Ads.\nAdmittedly, I didn’t think too much about the audience penetration metric when I first start getting rolled out across our accounts. But then after I did a little bit of a deep dive into the data, I’m a big fan. And I’m about to share all the really cool insights right after this short break.\nThe LinkedIn Ads Show is proudly brought to you by B2Linked.com, the LinkedIn Ads experts.\nB2Linked is the ad agency 100 percent dedicated to LinkedIn Ads.. And we have been ever since 2014. You know, back before it was cool. We build a custom strategy for every account we work with. You get to work directly with me and my local team.

It was really good this year. There were 12,000 attendees in Boston. The keynotes were crazy, I got to hear Serena Williams, the tennis player, Kara Swisher, the tech journalist, I’ve been listening to her podcast for years, . David Spade was our stand up comedian on one of the nights and Ryan Reynolds was our closing keynote. I couldn’t have asked for more in the celebrities department.\nNext year, they announced that Inbound is going to be held in San Francisco instead of Boston, which I’m pretty excited about. And for those of you loyal listeners who attended and came to my presentation, thank you. It was awesome to get to meet so many of you.\nAnd thanks for coming up to say hi.\nWe got a new feature. Predictive audiences has a new version rolling out. So you might have access to it now, or it might just be coming into your account here in the next few weeks. But Kasper Hundebal Hamann from Denmark, he’s in our LinkedIn Ads fanatics group, and he brought it to my attention. So, historically, we’ve been able to create predictive audiences from contact lists. That was pretty much it. Well, now, you’ll be able to create a predictive audience from a retargeting list. So, let’s say, your website visitors, you can create a predictive audience that looks like them. Or those who watch 50 percent of one of your video ads, you can now create a predictive audience that looks like them. You can also create it from conversions, or people who interact with lead gen forms. I am aware currently of a beta where you can create predictive audiences from company lists, not contact lists.\nSo , we have some of our clients on that. I won’t be too surprised if that rolls out in the next quarter or so, if performance looks good.\nYou know I love to hear from you. If you have a question, a review, or feedback for the show, you can message me on LinkedIn. My DMs are free and open. Or you can always email us at podcast@b2linked.com. And if you attach a voice recording from you, I’ll play them right here on the show, and I’m happy to shout you out, or keep you anonymous, just let me know.\nAlright, onto the topic at hand, let’s hit it. Audience penetration is a pretty simple metric. What it is, is it’s the total unique reach of your campaign, divided by the total audience size. So that means the number of unique individuals in your target audience, who have seen at least one impression, divided by the total.\nIf you have it, you can see it underneath columns delivery. It might still be rolling out to accounts. So if you don’t see it yet, you’ll probably get it soon. What this does is it helps us calculate what percentage of our audience received at least one impression. And it’s a great way to understand how much of your ideal target audience you’re reaching, and especially how much you aren’t able to reach. But we’ll get into that a little bit more later.\nYou can calculate this manually, and I used to do this for clients, but it was very manual. Because there’s no easy way to export your audience sizes for campaigns. You have to go into the edit process of every campaign and manually write it down.\nIt’s a huge pain. But at least you do get the reach metric easily from an export.\nAll right, so my first hack I want to share with you is actually calculating your total audience size. Because like I said, you can’t get a report from LinkedIn with it, but you can use this new metric to calculate it. And this is actually in your favor, because when you look at LinkedIn’s estimated audience size, it’ll say something like 100, 000 plus, but it’s not going to tell you the exact number.\nBut when you use this hack to calculate it, it appears to be more accurate. But we’ll see, I’d love to hear your feedback. So what you do, export your campaign data to Excel and then create another column that is your reach column divided by your audience penetration percentage, this new column. And if you do this, the result is going to be your total audience size.\nSo how does it work? I think it actually works really well. I did a full calculation for one of our clients. Reach numbers are exact. They’re down to the single number. And the audience sizes are always estimated, saying a certain number of hundreds of thousands or whatever, and above. So, theoretically, if you calculate your audience size from your reach, it might be more accurate. The audience sizes I calculated were 330, 000 from a 310,000 estimated audience. That checks out. One was 9, 972 from an audience that told me it was 7, 900 or above, that also checks out.\nI did end up getting a couple, especially from larger audiences would say around 610, 000 from an audience that LinkedIn in campaign manager says is 660, 000.\nSo about half the time the calculated audience was larger than the audience size that campaign manager told us. And half the time it was below. But every time it was below, it was always in the much larger audiences. These audiences with, you know, 400, 000 plus, which by my standard are very large audiences, and I don’t like to run audiences that large. But in all cases, they were within about 10 percent of each other, which feels good.\nAll right. So now you have a tool to be able to calculate your audience sizes without having to write those down individually. Very helpful. The next hack I want to share with you is how to determine how much your bids are affecting your reach. We know that bids have a big effect on reach because LinkedIn’s system is an auction.\nSo, let’s say that you’re bidding artificially low. Let’s say you’re bidding like 7 per click when LinkedIn is recommending $20 per click for that audience. It makes sense that you won’t reach everyone in your audience. Since you’ll probably lose most of the auctions where you’re purporting to show your ads.\nSo as you bid higher you qualify in the auction to show to more unique individuals So your reach should go up But the amount that it goes up is really really important. Alright, so here’s the test you bid really low for a month And you see an audience penetration percentage on that audience of like 10%.\nOkay. So then you decide to up your bid to let’s say 10 per click instead of seven. You do that for a month and you check your audience penetration score. Let’s say that that increases from 10% to 14%.\nOf course, you could obviously test this with much higher bids. Maybe you’re using LinkedIn’s recommendation of $20 per click. But what this is teaching you is that if you want to reach more of the members of your audience, then you’ll have to pay X percent more. So in this theoretical example, to get an extra 4 percent of your audience, you have to increase your click costs by 30%.\nSo if you raise your bids significantly, let’s say you raise them to $20 per click, and your audience penetration score goes to 15%, you’ve now bid what LinkedIn was recommending anyway, which likely means that you would win the majority of auctions. And what that means is if you still have 85 percent of your audience that is untouched for a whole month, you’ve just determined that 85 percent of your audience is not active on LinkedIn over the course of 30 days.\nThat’s really good information to have.\nWhen you do this test, you can also start to determine Okay, if I bid three times as much to get 5 percent more of my audience to see my ads, was that worth it in the hit of my efficiency to do it? You might determine that, yes, it’s worth it to get that extra 5%. In most cases, I’m going to say, no, I’d rather stick with the 10 percent I can get and pay realistic amount.\nAll right, the next hack I have for you, I’m actually really excited about. This is measuring your audience overlap. If you’re a meta advertiser, you know, they actually have an audience overlap tool where you can calculate this, but LinkedIn has never had anything like that.\nRumyana Kercheva , who’s in our LinkedIn Ads fanatics community. She pointed out something really interesting. She said the greatest part of this new audience penetration metric is that audience overlap is in the totals row. So you can see your total audience penetration when you’re inspecting individual campaigns. And I didn’t realize that it would account for the overlap. I think it’s super cool because we’ve never been able to calculate it. So to test this, I analyzed campaigns that were targeting the same exact audience. I selected both of those campaigns and looked at the total audience penetration.\nOne of them had 15. 7 percent penetration and the other had 0. 5%. It was because it didn’t run very long, it didn’t spend very much. But when you click both of them and you see the penetration metric, it said the average was 15. 7%, which is the exact number of the one that had the highest penetration.\nWhich tells me those two campaigns had nearly 100 percent overlap, which makes perfect sense because they are the same audience. So what that means is, campaign one with most penetration It hit all 15. 7 percent of those people, and then campaign two that only hit 0. 5, those 0. 5 were part of the 15. 7 percent that had already been reached in the other campaign.\nSo I thought that was really cool. Then I wanted to compare different audiences, and I wanted to calculate what the average penetration could be between them.\nWhen I did the manual math of reach and total audience size, I calculated 13. 3 percent audience penetration, but when I look at them in Campaign Manager, it shows me 12. 9 percent. So that remaining 0. 4 percent is the likely overlap between those audiences. Which makes perfect sense because they were very different targeting, but there is going to be some overlap if you’re targeting similar kinds of audiences.\nI haven’t thought of a mathematical calculation to actually quantify the audience overlap, so I would love it if LinkedIn would come out with a tool like Meta. Otherwise, this is just me checking on a gut feel of what overlap looks like between audiences. That being said, if you’ve figured out a way to calculate this in any sort of meaningful way, I’d love to hear it from you, and I’d love to share it in a future episode.\nBig thanks to Kasper and Rumyana for pointing out the things that I pointed out in this episode.

And I’m sharing with you exactly how to get the same for your campaigns. On this week’s episode of the LinkedIn Ads Show.\nWelcome to the LinkedIn Ads Show. Here’s your host, AJ Wilcox.\nHey, hey, hey there LinkedIn Ads fanatics. As he said, I’m AJ wilcox. I’m the host of the weekly podcast, the LinkedIn Ads Show. I’m thrilled to welcome you to the show for advanced B2B marketers who want to evolve and master their craft and become true LinkedIn Ads pros.\nYou may have heard that the LinkedIn audience network, or LAN, produces bad quality traffic. You’ve probably heard it from me because I say that quite often. It hurts so bad to say that LAN traffic is garbage because I want to love it so much. Think about it. On LinkedIn, we have the best business targeting of any platform out there, but since most LinkedIn users aren’t active all the time, it’s super valuable to be able to reach them anywhere that they’re surfing around and not just sitting around twiddling our thumbs and waiting for them to come back to LinkedIn.\nThat’s exactly what the LAN network is supposed to do. And well, I may have fixed it. So in today’s episode, I’m going to share with you exactly what I did and how you can do it too. Plus, I’ll be sharing my block lists and whitelists for you that you can go and directly download and use in your campaigns.\nThe LinkedIn Ads Show is proudly brought to you by B2Linked.com, the LinkedIn Ads experts.\nB2Linked is the ad agency 100 percent dedicated to LinkedIn ads, and we have been since 2014. You know, back before it was cool.\nWe build a custom strategy for every account we work with, you get to work directly with me and my local team. You’re not going to get a cookie cutter approach or a standard account template from us. No way. No way. Plus with the strategies that we’ve developed and our mastery of the platform, we always save our clients more than we charge. So it’s kind of like getting the best in the biz for free.\nIf you’d like to explore partnering with us for your LinkedIn ads management, schedule your free discovery call with me, B2Linked.com/discovery.\nAlright, if you have a review, a question, or feedback for the show, you can message me privately on LinkedIn. My DMs are open and they’re free. Or you can always email us at podcast@b2linked.com. You can attach a link to a voice recording from you, and I’ll play it right here on the show. Or you can send text, I’ll read it on the show. I’m happy to keep you anonymous or share your details. So just let me know what your preference is. Either way, I want to feature you. All right, without further ado, let’s hit it.\nThis episode was a long time in the making. I’ve shared before. I want to love LAN traffic. But it’s been so terrible before, and I’ve spent hours with LinkedIn’s product team trying to understand why and how to fix it. I’ve read a bunch of content that others have published about their being bought and spam traffic on the LinkedIn audience network. I’ve taken those to the product team to try to understand it, and I’ve come to some conclusions.\nNow, of course, I reserve the right to change these conclusions as I gather more data and understand more, but here’s what it looks like. Yes, there is bot traffic that comes from LAN. You can see this in your analytics and server logs, but the cool part is, LinkedIn doesn’t charge us for the bot traffic, if it can tell that it’s bot traffic.\nI’ve been doing a lot of research on land traffic to try to understand it better, and I reached out to Dr. Agustin Fou, he’s the founder of Fou Analytics, because he’s published some incredible data and analysis on traffic quality across the various ad networks. Specifically, he’s got really cool ones on Google ads. And he’s even published a couple on LinkedIn.\nHis LinkedIn articles have gone absolutely viral. He’s a rockstar at spotting and interpreting bot and spam traffic. So I was really excited to get some of his help with this analysis.\nSo I installed his tool, Foo Analytics, on a client site to measure the traffic quality of the LinkedIn audience network. And I’m sharing this as a case study. The before and after data, the research, the analysis, and of course, my block lists. I hope this is hugely helpful to you. And of course, a huge shout out to Dr. Fou for his help with this analysis. What I did is I allowed LAN traffic from LinkedIn with no block or allow lists on a client site from September 3rd through September 11th.\nThen I implemented a pretty strict allow list that I’m going to share with you at the end of the show. And I measured the difference in traffic quality from that period to September 13th through 30th. And the results are pretty incredible.\nFirst, for those of you who don’t know about Foo Analytics, what it does is it breaks down traffic by everything you could possibly dream of, and much more. You can see the referring URL, all of the UTM parameters that were used in the traffic, the user agent, the operating system, the screen size, all of that. And even the specific apps by name that are driving traffic.\nI narrowed my traffic to just the visits that came from the UTM source LinkedIn, and then Fou Analytics breaks out the traffic into whether it’s a declared bot, or confirmed problematic, or even just suspicious. And then on the good side, it’ll break down whether it’s likely good or confirmed human.\nTo come up with that, it looks for clues in the technical makeup of the traffic, like whether the user agent actually agrees with the operating system and whether the referring URL makes sense, given what kind of traffic it is. It’s obviously very challenging to assess this, and I’m really glad that Dr. Fou took this on.\nAll right, so I compared the traffic from LinkedIn’s audience network against the traffic that arrived on the site and broke it down by these metrics.\nDuring the first time period, where we weren’t using any sort of block or allow list, LinkedIn charged us for just over 2000 clicks. And then when I looked at the analytics here, the site actually saw almost 4, 000 visits from LinkedIn with our UTM parameters.\nSo the natural reaction here is gonna say, Wow, I paid for 2, 000 visitors, and I got almost 4, 000 on the site. Sounds like a buy one, get one free deal, right? Well, not so much. Foo Analytics classified 2, 800 of these as being a bot, or problematic, or at least suspicious. And 1, 079 were classified as human or likely human.\nThen I went and calculated the ratio of good traffic to likely bad. And it was 37%, so 37 percent good versus 63 percent bad. Yikes. So we paid for 2, 000 clicks, we got about 1, 000 to the site that are human. And that’s probably about to be expected, because since display traffic almost always has a really high bounce rate, and there are certainly accidental clicks, 50 percent of the traffic that we pay for making it to the site actually feels pretty good.\nThen I analyzed the traffic after implementing this really strict allow list. And the results were quite different. So in our second time period, LinkedIn charged us for 1, 160 clicks, just over a thousand. The site saw 733 visits. So there’s a little bit of a drop off there from 1160 down to 733. The allow list that I used, and I’m sharing with you here at the end. This is only allowing the highest quality publishers on LinkedIn’s list. It’s sites like the New York Times, USA Today, Forbes, Business Insider, those kinds of places. They’re national publications that you’ve definitely heard of.\nAfter implementing this list, I recalculated this ratio of good to bad.\nThe ratio of good to bad was over a hundred, meaning that we had more good traffic hit the site than bad.\nSo we went from a good to bad ratio of 37 percent to 102 percent just by applying this allow list.\nThere is also a cost difference here. Before the allow list, I calculated my cost per good visitor, and it was just over a dollar. It was like a dollar and five cents. After the allow list, my cost per good visitor was four dollars and eight cents.\nAnd after implementing, I saw lower click through rates across the board.\nAlright, so why would we see higher costs and lower click through rates? I’ve got a couple theories. And I’ve also seen this same effect across multiple of our clients. I think it’s maybe because the sites that we’re being shown on are higher quality, and the ads aren’t as prominent. That would explain why our CPCs are a little bit higher.\nPlus, because they’re higher quality sites, there might be a lot more competition of other advertisers who want to show up there kind of bidding it up. Alternatively, we’re also right during peak political advertising season here in the US. And I’m thinking that the exchanges might be slammed with political ads and other competition driving costs up.\nIf this is the case, we’ll see if it all drops back down. If it is the additional competition from political ads, we’ll see after November 5th if our LAN click through rates go back up and our costs go back down.\nYou’re probably asking yourself, why are bots clicking on my LinkedIn Ads? I know because I wondered it and all of the clients I’ve talked to about it are all asking the same thing. The biggest reason why there’s bot traffic is that the ad exchanges have something called creative validators.\nTheir job is to click through the ads being shared on their exchange and do this regularly. And what they’re looking for is malware or anything else deceptive that would cause their users a bad experience.\nA bad actor, like a bad site who is trying to share malware, you wouldn’t want them to be able to block these creative validators. So, the creative validators, they have to look like humans, so that the bad actors don’t block them and get away with it.\nSo they purposely act human, and they attempt to evade detection. This isn’t a problem, because LinkedIn’s aware that the ad exchanges use this, and they’re not charging us for the traffic from them.\nThe other big reason that I’ve found why bots are clicking on ads, as far as I can tell, there are some very low quality apps where the developers, they know that they make more money when their users are watching ads. So what they do is they serve the ad and then they simulate a click on it behind the app while you’re using it.\nSo you or your child may be using the app and you might not know it clicked on an ad and showed it back behind the app. For instance, one of the apps before I blocked it with the block list is called WordTrend. And it alone accounted for 22 percent of all of the clicks for a campaign. And a hundred percent of those clicks were all categorized as bad. Not awesome at all. I would not recommend advertising on apps.\nAnd there is one important distinction that I want to share with you. And that’s the difference between a blacklist and a whitelist. I worked in computer networking for a few years, and so I understand this concept of blacklists and whitelists. LinkedIn’s LAN uses the same principle here, so I’ll walk you through how it works. What a whitelist does is it only allows traffic from a specific list of sites. And a block list, it only excludes traffic from a specific set of sites or apps that are on the list.\nSo I’m sharing my whitelist and my blacklist with you, but I would recommend only using the whitelist. There are pros and cons to both, but the downside of a whitelist is that if some new great partner site pops up on LinkedIn’s list, because you’re showing only to a specific list of sites, you won’t show up on that new awesome partner site.\nThe danger of a blacklist though, is that you could block undesirable publishers now, but let’s say a new site or app gets added next week, you’ll automatically start showing your ads on those new partners. So I think the pros of a whitelist outweigh the risks of a blacklist.\nSo here’s how to install either a blacklist or a whitelist. LinkedIn calls these block lists or allow lists. First download either the whitelist or the blacklist from the show notes below. Or if your podcast player doesn’t have show notes in it, you can just go to b2linked.com and then go to this podcast episode. It’s episode 150. Then inside of your campaign manager, click on plan in the left hand navigation and then go to brand safety and then upload list. Go ahead. I’ll wait. Nah, I’m just kidding. When it pops up asking about the list, you specify whether it’s a block list, which is what I’ve called a blacklist, or an allow list, which is what I’ve talked about being a whitelist. Give it your own name and upload it. Then you’ll need to go into the settings of each LAN enabled campaign. You scroll down to placements, and then click show brand safety options. Then click the little plus sign that says add publisher list. And then you can select either your white list or your black list.\nTa da! Now you’ve enabled your white or black list, and you are good to go. And you definitely don’t have to use my lists. You’re welcome to create your own. This was just a good way to get you started, so that you don’t have to comb through a thousand sites, one by one. It’s really monotonous, so I wanted to give you a leg up, because I already had to do it for our clients. I can’t say this enough, I highly recommend checking out and signing up for FooAnalytics. I don’t get anything for recommending it, I just legit can tell you that this is the best analytics platform for measuring traffic quality.\nIt provides the best intelligence I’ve found on spam and bot traffic. I’ve linked to Fou analytics down in the show notes. That’s FOUanalytics.com I’ve also linked to Dr. Fou’s LinkedIn profile, where he publishes awesome deep dives on traffic quality of ad networks. It’s amazing. You’re going to love following him.\nIn the show notes, I’ve also linked to both the white list and the blacklist that I recommend. I have already shared these block lists on the LinkedIn Ads fanatics community, so they got it first.

I’m going to walk you through the roadmap on this week’s episode of the LinkedIn Ads Show.\nWelcome to the LinkedIn Ads Show. Here’s your host, AJ Wilcox.\nHey, they’re LinkedIn ads fanatics. As he said, I’m AJ Wilcox. I’m the host of the weekly podcast, the LinkedIn Ads Show. I’m thrilled to welcome you to the show for advanced B2B LinkedIn advertisers who want to master LinkedIn Ads and achieve true pro status.\nIt’s been a while since we did an episode about the LinkedIn Ads roadmap, so I wanted to give you a glimpse into what might be coming that you can get excited about. If you’re a regular listener and you hear all the news sections of the podcast episodes, well, not all of this is gonna be a huge news to you. But just so you don’t have to go to every single episode, listen to the news section, and piece it together, I’m going to give it to you in one simple episode.\nAs always, don’t take these predictions as gospel, as they can change at any time. Sometimes they’re pretty decently accurate. Some things get pushed off a quarter or two, sometimes to the next year. You never know.\nThe LinkedIn Ads Show is proudly brought to you by B2Linked.com, the LinkedIn Ads experts.\nThat’s right. B2Linked is the ad agency 100 percent dedicated to LinkedIn Ads.. And we have been ever since 2014. You know, back before it was cool.\nWe build a custom strategy for every account we work with. You get to work directly with me and my local team. No cookie cutter approach or standard account templates from us. No Sir ree.\nPlus with the strategies that we’ve developed and our mastery of the LinkedIn Ads platform, we always save our clients more than we charge. So it’s kind of like getting the best in the biz for free. If you’d like to explore partnering with us for your LinkedIn Ads, Schedule your free discovery call with me today at b2linked.com/discovery.\nFirst off, in the news, I had a LinkedIn rep give me a piece of advice that I thought was actually really good and I wanted to share it out with you. They said, when you’re doing lead generation campaigns, reduce your intro text on the ads. We recommend keeping this between 100 and 220 characters to avoid being collapsed.\nAs an aside from me here. I’ve never seen an intro that went into the 200s of characters that didn’t get truncated with the see more. So, I like to keep it, um, they say 100 to 220. I would say keep it between 100 and 160. Back to their quote. Advertisers who write campaign creatives that are in this range will reduce cost per lead by 6. 9%. This will also prevent your call to action from being cut off. Alright, so the reason for this, if in a lead generation objective campaign, if you have fewer characters in the intro and you don’t get dot dot dot see more, what happens is in lead generation campaigns, when someone clicks the See More link, it charges you your cost per click.\nSo if you’re bidding, let’s say $10 per click on those lead forms, anyone who clicks on that ends up charging you your $10 without triggering the lead form. I think this is awful, and I really wish LinkedIn would change this. Okay, So this is why it works. If you can keep your intros short enough that it doesn’t truncate with the see more more, what ends up happening is you’ll see a lower cost per lead because now you’re not getting charged for clicks that just allow them to see more ad copy. You’re only getting charged for the clicks that would trigger a lead form opening. Great advice. I highly suggest you take it.\nNext, one of the super fanatics in our LinkedIn Ads fanatics community, which if you haven’t joined yet, you got to get in there.\nSo this is Anthony Blattner. He shared that dynamic sponsored content may be coming soon. He said, &quot;LinkedIn has a new alpha rolling out for dynamic sponsored content. Super interesting and would be a great feature to have.&quot;\nAnd then he shared some examples of Salesforce ads that are obviously single image, but they have personalizations or macros in them.\nThe three examples he shared, one of the examples dynamically inserted the industry, one inserted their prospect’s name, and another inserted their company name.\nI think this is a total no brainer to do, because LinkedIn allows us to do this in spotlight ads, and, message ads, conversation ads, we can use these dynamic variables. Of course it makes sense to have them bring it over and allow us to use these in, our normal sponsored content or other newsfeed ads.\nSo bravo, LinkedIn. Sounds like this is in an alpha right now, but of course, we’re very excited to see it go beta and then get rolled out.\nAll right. You, yes, you, do you have a question? Feedback for the show, or even a review that you can share? Message me on LinkedIn, or you can email us at podcast@b2linked.com. You can attach a voice recording of you sharing this, and I would love to play it right here on the show. Or of course you can leave dumb text. That’s totally fine too.\nI’ll play them right here on the show. Just let me know if you want me to keep you anonymous or shout your details out as well. I hope you know, I want to feature you. So please reach out. My DMs are open and they’re free.\nAll right, without further ado, let’s hit it. Some of these roadmap items have already launched. So I’m going to share some of the things that have already launched that you can expect, some things that are probably in your account right now or are being rolled out, and then maybe what you can expect in the coming quarters and next year.\nFirst off, sponsored articles came out first, and then that allowed us to start doing sponsored newsletters. I definitely want to have more content about sponsored newsletters. I’ve been testing them personally on our own account, so I’ll have more there. But right now, performance doesn’t seem to be amazing on like a cost per newsletter subscriber, but we’ll see. I’ll give you some updates there. We’ve had this now for a quarter, maybe two quarters, so you’ve got access to this now.\nNext is something called Content Hub. This is where LinkedIn says we can explore all existing paid and organic content new elevated entry point to your content library. This is currently in beta. So if I understand this right, this is probably one hub, one location, where you can see your company posts, hopefully maybe employee posts, that make it easy to turn into thought leader ads.\nOur ads content, maybe imagery and past a copy that we’ve used. I’d love to have that all in one location. For those of you who are already in the beta. I’m not, so I would love it if you’d reach out and just share a little bit about your experience. And I’d love to get to share what you’re learning.\nSomething else is called reserved ads. This is actually really exciting. This is where you could reserve the first ad slot. Allowing your ad to be shown at the top of the LinkedIn feed.\nI remember early days in Google ads, back when it was AdWords and you could give preference, like, Hey, I only want to bid on this keyword if I can be in the top, you know, one to three slots or something, it sounds like this is coming.\nIt’s slated for the first half of 2025. So we’ve got a little time to prepare for this. Of course, we have no idea how pricing’s gonna work. I’m gonna guess that we’re gonna pay a premium to show up in the, the first slot. , but I’m not sure. As you know, that first ad slot, it’s the second newsfeed item in your newsfeed.\nThe next one is kind of similar. This one’s called primetime ads. This is where they’re gonna make it so we can achieve a 100% reach with your target audience for 24 hours in the LinkedIn feed.\nIt seems like this is kind of like a, like a homepage buyout like we used to be able to do with Yahoo of like for 24 hours, we’re going to pay you a chunk of money and we’re going to take over the whole homepage as an ad, but we’ll see how LinkedIn pulls this off. This is what they’re predicting for the second half of 2025. So we have a little bit longer to prepare for this. No clue how this is going to work bidding or budgeting wise, but I’m going to guess you’re going to pay a significant premium. Maybe it’s going to be a fixed cost. Maybe it’s by audience size, I don’t know, but you’re probably going to be able to pay for a 24 hour period to have your sponsored content ad pop up on the news feed from anyone who’s in your target audience, guaranteed.\nThe next is live event ads. So you probably know we’ve had event ads for a long time where you could promote a LinkedIn event through ads. But now we have a new special ad format for live events. Rather than just using a single image ad to describe the event and try to get people to sign up that way, this is where you get to promote a live event before the event, which we’ve always been able to do. But during the event, it pushes people to the live stream saying like, Hey, come join now it’s live. And then after the event is over, it pushes people back to the replay.\nIf you haven’t checked it out already, the retargeting options on this are pretty insane. You can retarget by what percentage of the event, the video, that someone watched. So you can say like, if someone made it 50 percent of the way through my event, put them into a retargeting audience. You can also retarget people by whether they registered or not, or how they engaged with the ads.\nThis is currently being rolled out. I’ve noticed that many of the accounts that I have access to have it.\nSo check and see, you might already have access.\nThe next is Connected TV, or for short, we call it CTV. Expect a future episode or two just on this topic because it’s truly epic. It allows any advertiser, in North America right now, I would assume we probably are going to get Europe at some point, any advertiser in North America can reach their ideal target audience on their home TV while they’re watching streaming services. You get to use LinkedIn’s targeting to narrow in on this, which is obviously way better than any other CTV platform out there. This is in a public beta now. So anyone who wants to can go get access. The ads are all non skippable, and you can use block lists and allow lists, like we talked about in episode 150. And to prepare for this, typically you’ll want to use either 15 second creatives or 30 second creatives, with no subtitles and the highest resolution you can get. 4K is great because they’ll actually play on someone’s TV in 4K. You can go into Campaign Manager right now and download a full publisher list of the publishers that your, your CTV campaigns can show up on. But these are things like Roku, Pluto TV, Peacock, Fox Sports, I think I saw Hulu in there, and a bunch of other really good ones.\nI don’t know how long the public beta lasts for. I don’t know the difference between a public beta and just having it generally available. But yeah, if you want to get into CTV, go test it out.\nThe next feature that’s coming is called buyer group targeting. This is where LinkedIn uses its own first party data, intent signals, et cetera, to easily allow you to target the whole buyer’s committee. Rather than having to, add all of those specific roles into your targeting manually.\nI think it’s gonna start from a list, a specific list of prospects and it’ll go and add all of the roles that surround that person who are likely in the decision making committee, the buyer’s committee. And then it’s going to create an audience in your audiences list that you can then attach to any campaign. Considering how well predictive audiences have been working, I think this is probably going to be really good, so I’m excited to test it out.\nThis is currently slated to come out in Q2 of 2025. But it’s already been through an alpha. My guess is probably beta is going on right now. So if everything goes well in the beta, it’ll probably release on schedule, maybe even ahead of schedule.\nNext is the conversions API. This allows advertisers to pass conversions back to LinkedIn with high accuracy and without relying on cookies, which we know we can’t really count on cookies anymore.\nThe partners that this launched with are like Google Tag Manager, Zapier, DreamData. I know HubSpot’s on there as well, and I’m sure lots more coming.\nYou can also expect an episode or two on the conversions API. Because we’re doing some really cool stuff with it that I’m excited to share in the future, but it’s taking me a while. So, hold off a little bit.\nAnd conversions API has already been rolled out. You should have access to it in your account right now.\nThe next is dynamic UTM parameters. What you can do is you can have account wide, or just campaign specific UTM parameters that are dynamically added inside of campaign manager to either your campaign or your whole account, meaning all the campaigns in your account. And that way, you don’t have to go and append every ad destination URL with all of these specific parameters. You can, of course, add static values like UTM source equals LinkedIn. But you can also have dynamic values like dynamically insert the campaign ID, or the campaign name, or the ad ID, and several others. This is already launched as well. You should have access to this in your account. It seems to work really well, but like we talked about in episode 146, which was like my dream list of features for LinkedIn, one of the weaknesses is that This will happen for all of your links that are destination URLs in your ads, but it won’t apply to links that are in your intro text, which seems like a simple enough thing to add. So we’ll see if LinkedIn can do that in the future.\nNext is publisher reporting. This is where you’re going to be able to get a report of your ad performance across outside publishers on LinkedIn. So this means that if you’re running on the LinkedIn audience network, Then you’d be able to get a breakdown of your performance on each of the sites on the LAN platform.\nOr if you’re running connected TV, like we talked about, you’ll be able to see basically how much you spent on each kind of partner that your ads have been shown on. I think this is rolling out for CTV already. And then the LinkedIn audience network, I’m going to guess is going to come in the next quarter, but I don’t have specifics for you on that one.\nThe next is dwell time reporting. This is out now. I’m pretty sure every account now has dwell time. And so go and check it out. I think it’s in your columns engagement to see dwell time. If you have more questions about that one, go listen to episode 140 of the podcast where we went super deep into dwell time.\nThe next feature here is the companies report. So this is where you can measure specific ad engagement for all of the companies who they’ve been shown to. This is really cool because I’m sure you know that if you go into the demographics, you can only see, I think it’s the top 10 or 20 companies who’ve seen and engaged with your ads.\nBut this is going to show you all of them, 100%, at least the ones who are attached to company pages, I’m guessing. This is currently in beta. We have a couple clients who are in it, and it’s really cool. One of the other awesome things about it is LinkedIn will give you a measure of which of these accounts are high engagement, low engagement, somewhere in between.\nAnd you can create dynamic lists. Hey, any company who seems to be highly engaged right now, let’s create them as an audience that we can then target more specifically later. Really cool. I’m really excited for this one to roll out.\nNext, we have qualified leads reporting. This is where you get to report back to LinkedIn, which leads have become qualified leads. And that’s going to feed those signals and reporting back to LinkedIn to help them optimize your campaigns to get you more qualified and fewer of the ones that don’t become qualified.\nThis should already be out, but if it’s not, it’s probably coming really soon.\nNext is buyer journey insights. LinkedIn says you can evaluate your buyer journey and gain actionable insights. I’m not totally sure what this means. I’m guessing that we’ll be able to visualize the multiple touch points that any specific brand had in how they’ve engaged with our ads on their way to becoming a customer. Uh, or maybe this is just people who are in like a qualified lead status, we can see more specifically, what did they engage with and how they got there? This is slated for Q4 of 2024. So really this could happen in the next month or two. I’m really excited to see how LinkedIn pulls this off. And if it’s much different than say, like revenue attribution report, it’s probably using a lot of the same tech and reporting.\nNext is a type of reporting called share of voice. We already got audience penetration, and we also got dwell time. So this is a pretty obvious addition to our reporting. I get asked actually fairly regularly by clients to give them some sort of a share of voice report. Obviously only LinkedIn knows this because LinkedIn will know who your competitors are. I hope we actually get to specify specific competitors, but LinkedIn has a pretty good idea. They know what they’re spending. They know what those accounts have in terms of penetration and, and all of that. We don’t get any sort of insights into that without knowing what our competitors are doing. So I’m really excited for this one. This should be out in Q4. So this quarter of 2024.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, we’re supposed to get something called measurement insights. I don’t actually know what this is from reading the description. I couldn’t really get much of an insight into it whatsoever. So we’ll see as more details come out, what is Measurement Insights actually going to give us insights into.\nThere is a feature coming called Cleanroom Advanced Insights. This should be coming in the first half of 2025. We can already go through a LinkedIn partner to do the clean room, but it’s an added cost to pay for that clean room. And I haven’t had any clients pony up for this yet, so I haven’t gotten a chance to play with it.\nBut if LinkedIn’s announcing that this is coming, I’m guessing that this is something that LinkedIn’s actually going to build into campaign manager somehow. I’m not sure if there’s going to be an additional fee like it is now. No clue, but I’m really excited to see. For any of you who are listening who have access to the Cleanroom right now, I would love it if you could reach out and just share what are the insights that you actually get from Cleanroom. How does it work for you?\nNow jumping into the new features of Business Manager. Uh, Business Manager now allows block lists and allow lists at the Business Manager level. This should already be launched. So if you have Business Manager, you can go check that out.\nTheoretically, it should be really nice to have these block or allow lists, like we talked about on the last episode. You can have those at the Business Manager level and then be able to use those in all the accounts that you have access to in Business Manager. I haven’t had a chance to play with this. So I don’t know if that means that we could share them with other business managers or if it’s just apply them to the account under a single business manager. Not totally sure, but this is launched already. So if you’re curious, you can pop in and see how it works.\nYou’ve probably already noticed that LinkedIn is now forcing two step verification on all business manager accounts and on any ad account for campaign manager. And if you don’t set that up, sorry, your profile doesn’t get access to your LinkedIn Ads account. This was really annoying, but I do have to say it would be an absolute disaster if someone got into, let’s say, my LinkedIn account and then could make changes across multiple accounts. It’d be pretty bad. So I think it’s the right thing security wise, but the way it got rolled out where it was just voiced it upon us, I wasn’t a fan of that.\nInside of Business Manager, though, now there’s an easy access to set up your monthly invoicing. Right now, by default, any ad account, it gets pushed right through a credit card. That credit card gets charged sometimes multiple times per day, which is a real pain for finance, especially if you’re, you know, spending quite a bit on LinkedIn Ads.\nAnd it used to be that you would have to go and apply for monthly invoicing. You’d have to have a certain amount of past history with the platform before they would accept it. So now this is really cool that it’s right within Business Manager and an easy application.\nThis quarter, in fact, you’re probably already seeing it now in some of your accounts. LinkedIn is suggesting ad copy to you by using AI. It’s suggesting headlines and intro copy for single image ads Also a note here about ad duplication. LinkedIn says you can copy multiple ads at once and use them across multiple campaigns. It says Q4, so I’m hoping that this is something that we see here in just the next coming weeks or months. Right now, we have the ability to duplicate ads. But it’s only when we duplicate the whole campaign.\nAnd that’s very weak, because sometimes you want to bring the ads over, but you don’t want to bring the audience over. Plus, the whole thing gets destroyed if you try to duplicate a campaign, but now you want to change the objective. Oh, good luck. So I’m guessing, and I’m hoping, that this ad duplication feature It means that it’s going to be a lot easier to move ads from one campaign to another, and we don’t have to rely on the duplication hack.\nAnother AI piece that’s getting rolled out. This is Microsoft Designer. We’ve talked about this before. It was announced at the B2Believe event. So if you listened to that episode, super cool. Is where we’ll get to use, I’m guessing it’s DALL·E on the back of it.\nAnd this is ChatGPT’s image creator, but now Microsoft has it inside of Microsoft Designer. This is going to be plugged into Campaign Manager. It should be coming this quarter, so I’m really excited to try it out. But basically, we’ll get to prompt it and say, this is the kind of imagery I want for my ads, and it will spit some of those things out. All right within LinkedIn, which is really cool. That way we don’t have to go to DALL·E outside.\nThe next feature here is called Media Planner. This is audience lists and campaign budgets that you can see before you launch. And you’ll get to see forecasted reach and impression. So it sounds great in theory. I just hope that the forecasts are much more accurate than the terrible campaign predictions that we have as we’re creating a campaign right now in Campaign Manager. This says that it’s coming in Q1 of 2025. So we should see it here in the next five, six months.\nNext feature here is Objective Aware Creative Rotation. So as you probably know, right now we have two settings for creative rotation. We have the optimized for performance, which I recommend most of the time. And then we have rotate evenly, which says that it rotates evenly, but it doesn’t. It just charges you more.\nWell, coming in Q1 of 2025, this is going to be another option where it will rotate your creatives based in part on the objective of the campaign. And it does mention that it uses AI for this. I’m not totally certain what it means. But I do think that if you were using the brand awareness objective, you might be wanting reach more than you want frequency, and so maybe it would show your ads based off of like, oh, this person has not yet seen this ad. Versus engagement, maybe it says, oh, this member has already engaged with an ad like this. So even though we might not otherwise, let’s show them this one.\nThis next one is already out, and in fact, we get nagged about it all the time, so I know it’s out. This is LinkedIn Accelerate. This is campaign creation with AI. Basically, every time I log into an account, even if I’ve been nagged before on that account, I still get a, hey, try LinkedIn Accelerate. Now I’m not totally opposed to it.\nI have had several people who’ve tried it out, who are reporting back that, yeah, it actually performs really well. But I am generally pretty against anything that’s a black box that I can’t learn from. And Accelerate. It creates a black box. I don’t get control over the audience, so I’m not in a rush to try it, but any of you who are trying it, I’d love to hear your feedback.\nAnd finally, predictive companies beta is happening right now.\nThis is like predictive audiences, but instead of predicting individuals who might be interested, I’d love to It’s taking a company list and it’s predicting companies who seem to be interested. I don’t know how this is gonna work. It’ll probably be out this quarter in Q4 of 2024.\nSo, I’ll be really excited to see it. But any of you who are part of that beta, please let me know how it’s working for you. I do think it’s going to be a lot harder for LinkedIn to find companies that would be interested in something as opposed to individuals, but who knows? AI is very powerful.\nIf you’re not already a member of the LinkedIn ads fanatics community, get over to fanatics.b2linked.com.

Please take my money. This one’s for you. We’re troubleshooting low delivery on this week’s episode of the LinkedIn Ads Show.\nWelcome to the LinkedIn Ads Show. Here’s your host, AJ Wilcox.\nHey, hey there, LinkedIn Ads fanatics. As he said, I’m AJ Wilcox. I’m the host of the weekly podcast, The LinkedIn Ads Show. I’m thrilled to welcome you to the show for advanced B2B marketers who are looking to evolve their craft and master LinkedIn Ads to become true pros. One of the problems that LinkedIn advertisers inevitably face is that when they launch a campaign it just doesn’t deliver or spend how you were hoping it would.\nIf you face that situation, this episode is for you. I’m going to walk you through all the same troubleshooting steps that me and my team do to help you actually get the delivery that you’re looking for.\nThe LinkedIn Ads Show is proudly brought to you by B2Linked.com, the LinkedIn Ads experts.\nB2Linked is the ad agency, 100 percent dedicated to LinkedIn ads. And we have been since 2014. Congratulations to us 10 years ago, but you know, that was back before it was cool. We build a custom strategy for every account we work with. You get to work directly with me and my local team. You won’t get any sort of cookie cutter approach or standard account templates from us.\nPlus, we’ve developed the strategies with our mastery of the platform, where we save our clients way more than we charge. So it’s kind of like getting the best in the biz for free.\nIf you’d like to explore partnering with us for your LinkedIn ads management, schedule your free discovery call with me today, at B2Linked.com/discovery.\nFirst off in the news, B2Linked hit our 10 year anniversary this month. I’m stoked. Looking back at the last 10 years, it’s flown by. Definitely doesn’t feel like 10 years, but I’m just super excited.\nIf you see me walking around with a party hat on or blowing one of those, I don’t know what you call them, like party blowers, the anyway, you’ll know why it’s celebrating our 10 year anniversary.\nI also just got back from speaking at the Content Marketing World 2024 and the Marketing Analytics Data Science event in San Diego. I have to say, it was totally an awesome event. Fantastic speakers and topics, several gray ones at every time slot, so I couldn’t attend everything I wanted, I was interested in.\nSo, I’m really excited to get to the replays. Historically, this conference has been in Cleveland, Ohio, but it got acquired, and last year it was in Washington, D. C. This year, and already confirmed for next year, it’s in San Diego, California. It’s got lots of great content. Mainly focused at enterprise B2B companies. So if you fit that, I highly recommend checking it out next year, just in case if you missed it this year. And it was so great getting to meet several of you loyal listeners there after my talk. Thank you for coming to introduce yourselves.\nAlso in the news, you’ve probably seen this pop up in your account probably several times. You try to dismiss it and it just keeps coming back. It’s the pop up that says, Sponsored messaging coming soon to the EU. Starting mid October, 2024, subject to change, LinkedIn will reintroduce targeting for European union members who agreed to receive sponsored messaging ads in their LinkedIn inbox.\nIf you’re a LinkedIn member in the EU, you’ve probably gotten a pop up of some sort asking you for what your preferences are to be shown ads in the inbox. That’s what this is about. So I don’t know what percentage of EU members have actually consented to this kind of ad.\nI kind of don’t know why they would, but for those who are, this is actually really great for those of us who are having a lot of success using either conversation ads or message ads, in other areas of the world, that we may want to expand that to the EU, we haven’t been able to so far.\nOur stopgap for doing this was using click to message ads in the EU. We can do that because it starts out as a single image ad, and then only when they click it, do they move over to a message. But those are also kind of cumbersome to build.\nAll right, do you have a question, a review, or feedback for the show? Message me on LinkedIn, or you can always email us at podcast@b2linked.com.\nYou can attach a link to a voice recording from you. That’s by far the coolest, because then I can just play it right here on the show. And of course, if it makes you feel uncomfortable, just let me know. I’m happy to keep you anonymous, but of course, I’d always love to shout you out. I want to feature you. All right, without further ado, let’s hit it.\nYou may have faced this situation where you have launched a campaign and you have literal zero spent on it. There are lots of different reasons why this could happen. So I’m going to walk you through each of them. And of course, if I miss any, please do reach out to me and give me a correction. And I’d love to shout you out in the next episode. And of course, fix it. So this can be as complete as possible.\nObviously you want to start out by checking all of the standard things. Like, is the campaign group active? Is the campaign active? Are all of the ads active? Sometimes one of the ads will get disapproved or something, and you’re wondering why it’s not spending. You probably got an email about it, but you might have missed it.\nYou need to go and make sure that you actually have active ads, campaign, and the campaign group. Also check the billing information in the account. Just in case the credit card fails or something, the account could have gone down. You might’ve missed the big red banner at the top that says your billing failed.\nYou need to go in and fill out your credit card information, whatever it is, just make sure you’ve checked your billing info. But assuming that’s all good, the next step is to actually check that your campaign is actually not delivering.\nMost of the time when I see this, it’s because we’re using the website visits or the website conversions objective. And what happens is if you see 0 in spend or zero clicks, You might think, oh, it’s not serving,\nIn these objectives, you only pay when someone clicks on the link. So you might actually have other engagements happening. You might be serving impressions. You might be getting reactions and comments and clicks to your company page. So make sure that you flip your columns to the engagement set of columns. That way you can actually see. Even if you’re not getting clicks and spending anything, you might be getting all of those engagements. And of course, if you are, you’re getting them for free, which I love.\nI also really like selecting the campaign and clicking on performance chart, and then you view the performance by impressions. Over the course of days, if you are delivering, you will see impressions.\nIf this is sponsored messaging, though, you’ll need to switch to sponsored messaging sends. That’ll show you that sends are happening, even though you may not be getting any Opens or clicks or anything like that.\nThere are some reasons why this could happen. Number one, it could be that your audience is really small or maybe not super active on the platform. And if that’s the case, you might find that there aren’t enough of the people coming online every day to see your ads to then generate any clicks or spend. But it could also be that your campaign has a really poor relevancy score, or at least compared to your competition, your relevancy score might be less than theirs. And so you may just have to increase your bids sometimes multiple times until you can really make it worth LinkedIn’s while to start serving those ads.\nTo fix this while you’re manually bidding, I suggest keep bidding a little higher and a little higher every couple days until you start to see something. Obviously, once it gets ridiculous to the point where you’re like, yeah, I don’t want to bid any higher because I’m not actually willing to pay this much for a click, stop and move on to the next troubleshooting step.\nI also want to mention, occasionally I’ll see a glitch in LinkedIn’s campaign manager where the data is there. It’s just not updating for a day. When this has happened in the past, the ads are actually serving normally, but campaign manager isn’t showing you the updates. And so, if you’ve fallen into this trap like I have, You go and increase your bids several times during the day. And then all of a sudden when it updates tomorrow, you see that you just paid way more per click than you needed to. I can only remember this happening like twice in the past year. So it’s pretty rare. Be aware. Sometimes you don’t want to just keep increasing and increasing because it might actually be running and you just can’t see that it’s serving.\nWhen you are manually bidding, another troubleshooting step that you can try is actually switch to maximum delivery bidding. If low bids are the reason that the campaign’s not spending, when you switch to maximum delivery, you’re now paying by the impression, which means you’re going to pay every single time LinkedIn shows it to someone.\nAnd LinkedIn will generally bid as high as it takes on CPM to spend the whole daily budget. And then some, you’ll probably overspend by 50%.\nSo if that fixes it and it starts spending wildly, that could just be an issue of not having aggressive enough bids. And you may have to decide if you want to leave it on maximum delivery or go and significantly increase your bids.\nIf that doesn’t work, the next thing you want to check is to see how small or inactive that audience is. Sometimes we notice, especially with like contact lists or ABM lists, you might have an audience size of like 300 or 800 people. Especially if that audience isn’t super active on LinkedIn, they might just be coming to the platform so slowly that they’re not going to spend any sort of budget that you want them to. If that’s the case, I would suggest, be patient. Don’t expect that this campaign is going to spend a ton. Don’t give it astronomical daily budgets. Just give it enough that you know it’s going to keep trudging along and staying in front of those people every time they do happen to get on the LinkedIn. You may want to check the performance monthly instead of weekly. And aggregate the data that way, just so you don’t get impatient.\nPersonally, I would avoid using maximum delivery since your effective cost per click are likely going to be really high. But if you’re desperate to spend as much as possible on that audience, maximum delivery bidding is one of the tools in your tool belt.\nNow, if you’ve looked and it’s not a particularly small audience, or you don’t really think that this could be an inactive audience on LinkedIn. This may actually just be a glitch.\nThis actually does happen fairly often. You may find that your campaign or the ad, something there gets messed up on LinkedIn’s side, it won’t show you an error, it just won’t serve.\nSo if it is one of these glitches, the fastest way I’ve found to solve it is to duplicate the campaign and the ad and launch again.\nIt seems crazy because this campaign is going to have exactly the same ad format, objective, targeting, all of that. The ad looks exactly the same, but it has a new ad ID. And sometimes that clears it.\nNow, if all of these troubleshooting steps fail and you’re still not sure why, the next step is to contact LinkedIn Ads support. You can either click on the chat icon that’s in the bottom right of campaign manager, Or you can navigate to LinkedIn’s help section and click around repeatedly until it finally lets you submit a, an email ticket.\nIf you’re not already a member of the LinkedIn ads fanatics community, what are you waiting for? Get over to fanatics.b2linked.com.\nThere you’ll find all of the top minds and LinkedIn ads who are sharing with each other, what’s working. Plus you get access to all four of our courses that take you from beginner to expert.\nI respond directly to every question there. So it’s definitely worth your while if you have especially hard questions.\nPlus there’s an upgraded level that we call our super fanatics. That gives you access to a weekly group call with me where you get to ask any question and get feedback.\nAgain, that’s fanatics.b2linked.com. If this is your first time listening, welcome. We’re excited to have you here. Make sure to hit that subscribe button. But if this is not your first time listening because you’re a loyal listener, thank you. I love you.

This is something I've been looking forward to for some time.\n We're going to be talking about reputation management specifically. And I know this is going to kind of intersect with some of the questions I'm going to ask you, but can you just talk to us a little bit about what is reputation management and why should B2B advertisers care?\n Great question. So obviously we wrote the whole book on that reputation King, because it's a very important concept in marketing, sales, advertising, driving conversion, because there's an old saying and we've all heard it a thousand times. We buy from people we know, like, and trust.\n And reputation management is a huge part of creating that trust and that likability reputation management is something that is universal across the web. In other words, when you do a Google search or Bing search, pick your search engine and you put in ABC.com reviews or XYZ product reviews. You're looking for signals of a positive reputation and that's going to come in a couple of ways. That's going to come vis-a-vis top search results. And it's going to come vis-a-vis review stars in those search results. So it could be a Google ads, it could be Google shopping. It could be your website. It could be a third party review site or a number of third party review sites. So really reputation management is making sure that you're visible in a positive way in organic and paid search results. And you have positive reputation on your website, primarily on your homepage category pages and your product pages. Because those are the pages where people are going to be looking for trust signals. Do I trust this website brand product, et cetera. So reputation management is really a plethora of things. It's not just one thing. It's all of that. It's what happens in search and it's what happens in your website.\n And the thing that really cuts me about reputation management is if you do a reputation management poorly or you don't have a strategy around it, your metrics from your LinkedIn advertising or any other marketing, you won't actually see it in the metrics. All you'll see is conversion rate looked fine and then poof, they're gone in the sales cycle. When sales reaches out to them, they don't respond. And it's really difficult to know, like is reputation management a concern? Because as soon as it's a concern, you just never hear from him ever again. Do I kind of have that right?\n Completely people won't say, Oh, I didn't buy from you, or I didn't engage with you, or I didn't take your call or answer your email because you have a bad reputation. Now some people may, but it's going to be the one percenters. The vast majority of just going to ghost you. That's just how it works. So we've all heard of eat expertise, authority and trust. That's the Google eat criteria.\n They've actually added another E which is experience. Google wants to see that you have experience, expertise, authority and trust.\n And trust of course, is part of that reputation management equation. And it helps with your search results. And the reason it's important to Google is because it's important to consumers.\n Google only cares about consumers care about because they know that if they serve up a website or an ad that people don't engage with click on and trust, they gave them a bad source, a bad ad, a bad website, because what Google wants is clicks and conversions. They want to make sure that the consumer is happy with the results they served up. And trust of course, is part of that equation. So you absolutely have to be very, very engaged and proactive in your reputation. And unfortunately a lot of executives kind of push that off to, you know, an underling. You take care of our reviews, you get us a review platform, but the reality is, and this is why we wrote the book, it's for e-commerce executives. Because if you don't own your reputation and take it seriously, then nobody else will. Because quite honestly, they don't care. It's your reputation. It's your brand at stake. It's not theirs.\n It's true. And maybe someone who's like your head of SEO, for instance, maybe they might pick up on some of this and say, Oh, this directly affects me, but it directly affects everyone's marketing, but you may just not know it. You may be like, Oh, that's the sales teams issue or that's SEOs, but it really does. It has its fingers in everything.\n Yeah. It has a ripple effect. It's one of those things where it ripples across everything from search visibility, paid ad performance, click through rates, conversion rates, average order value, bounce rates, lifetime value. All of those are affected by your reputation, whether they're consciously being affected by the consumer or not. People are always thinking about, do I trust this company? Do I trust this brand? And it's just one of those subconscious layers happening underneath that they may not even be aware of, but it's driving their decisions.\n Love it. This is so interesting to me. I read this book about e-commerce and I went, Oh my gosh, I have to have you on my podcast to talk about this for B2B. Like this is not even your ideal audience that you speak to, but it has so much of an effect here. Talk to us a little bit about like what you've seen from B2B and what you would see specifically relating to LinkedIn ads. What can and should we be aware of? What should we be looking for? You know, feel free to go on a tirade here.\n Great question. First of all, about a quarter of our clients are B2B. So we have a lot of B2B online sellers, online stores. So we get very involved in that space. In fact, one of the largest registration, URL registration companies is our client.\n And so reputation reviews, social proof are just as important in B2B as our B2C because we're humans. When we go to work and we're in our B2B environment, we don't suddenly take off our human hat and become something else. We're still looking for the same trust signals, the same credibility, the same points of validity that would cause us to like or prefer or buy from one brand versus another. So the trust signals are the same regardless of who we're selling to B2G, B2B, B2C. Now back to your question about how can we convey that in our LinkedIn ads? Because obviously that's what your audience is all about. Well, show popularity. What is social proof? Social proof is conveyed in basically two ways, either popularity, billions and billions served. Who has that in their signs today?\n McDonald's.\n McDonald's, right? It started out millions and it was billions and now it's billions and billions. That's social proof. What does that mean? That means billions and billions of people have trusted this company.\n I should too. How could billions and billions of people be wrong? So that's one form of social proof. Another obviously is long lines. We all want to go to the popular movies, the popular restaurants, the popular concerts, the popular events. We don't want to be the only ones in the restaurant or the only ones in a bad movie.\n We are looking for popularity. Popularity is a sign of credibility.\n So that's part of social proof. So for example, in your ads, you can show 73,000 clients served or serving 73,000 businesses just like yours.\n Okay. Now that's a whole nother layer because we're serving 73,000 businesses like yours, which means not only is that social proof, but people like me, people in my tribe, people in my group, people in my community are actually using this company. So that's one way you can do it. Another way of social proof, which is more subtle is in business since 1991.\n Well, what does that convey? That means you're stable. You're in it for the long haul. A lot of people must like you, know you and trust you because you've been in business for a long time.\n And of course, another one is 7,462, 4.5 star reviews. So now you're showing the number of reviews and the average star rating very, very easy to do in ads. You show 4.5 stars and you show the number of reviews and that shows both the ranking and social proof vis-a-vis the number of people that have left reviews. So those are some great ways to show social proof, credibility and longevity in your ads in business sense, how many clients served, how many reviews, average star rating. And those don't have to be huge, but they should be there. And by the way, a big pet peeve of mine of talking about ads is making sure that your landing page from that ad reflects the same levels of trust, same assets, same color palettes, same messaging social proof because people want to make sure they're in the right place when they click on that ad and they didn't get hijacked off somewhere else. So you're continuing that flow of credibility authority and social proof through to your landing page.\n Oh, I love that. What I especially love about some of these things that you've shared, you could add these to almost any ads you're running.\n Yes.\n It doesn't encumber your ads too much to show a stars rating and just put that on top of one of the single image ads you're running.\n Yeah.\n Doesn't take up a whole lot of room and it silently conveys that no like and trust.\n Exactly. I mean, we're all the same when we were going to travel, we're going to look at hotels, airlines,\n restaurants. We're going to look at reviews. If we've never been there, if we've never bought from that company, we're looking for social proof.\n You know how many people are endorsing this company, this business, this product? 94% of people statistically look at reviews before they buy a product, 94%.\n So it would just go with the ad. If 94% of people are going to look for reviews before they buy the product, why don't you just give them that upfront in the ad? So they already are pre-suaited to have trust and credibility in the ad to create a higher click through rate. So Dr. Tialdini wrote the book, Influence,\n and he also wrote the book, Presuasion and the book Presuasion is all about setting people up psychologically for the sale, which means putting them in a positive mindset about your brand and or product before they even engage with the landing page or ad. So that's what reviews do. They pre-suede them to have trust in your product, brand and company before they even get to the landing page.\n I love that. All right. So you may have already answered this to a degree, but for us as B2B advertisers, if we know we need to start including some of these things to try to engineer this experience, can you tell us what customers are specifically looking for? What are those signals that they care most about so that we can make sure that we're including those on our landing pages and in our ads?\n Okay. So on the ad, here's some things that you can consider. One is having a picture of the owner, founder, CEO, looking directly at the camera, eye to eye contact, and a genuine smile. Not a fake smile, a genuine smile with a crow feet and the whole thing, right? A genuine smile because that creates likability.\n And again, people buy from people. They always buy from people and they want to trust people. They want to know who they're buying from. They don't trust entities nearly as much as they do companies. You look at Elon Musk. Elon Musk and his social channels are exponentially more popular than the brands channels. Why? They want to know what Elon Musk is saying and doing and thinking, not what Tesla's doing, right? So think about connecting with people on a personal level. Back at Kodak, when I was in sales, I was in enterprise B2B sales with Kodak out of college and we had our full color picture on our business cards printed on Kodak paper, of course. But you wouldn't believe how many people commented on those business cards and how often I got through the gatekeepers because my picture was on my business card. People could connect with me before they even met me. Wow. So that human connection is important. Of course, having the social proof, years in business, number of reviews, average star rating are all important. How many companies served now in the landing page? And this is something that is more and more often missed, but a very critical thing to create trust. And that is putting your phone number in the upper right corner of your landing page and throughout your website. Even if people don't call that number, they just want to know that they can. They want to know that there's somebody on the other end of that number. If they have a question, a problem, a concern, et cetera. People get very nervous with brands that hide behind the website. And it's very difficult, if not impossible to actually talk to a human being. So that's just a little thing. And then put your actual physical address in the footer. They want to know that you have a real building, a real place of business, and that you're headquartered at 123 Main Street, Dubuque, Iowa, or whatever it is. And that they can call you.\n Oh, those are big. Couple of nuance questions here. These are more selfish. I think on my part, we're a small agency and we had an office building, but no one went in, so we ended up scrapping it. And now we all work from home, which means if I go to follow this, I would be putting my number in the corner. I would be putting my address probably at the bottom. Is that a backfire situation? Is that a situation where you're like, yeah, you might not want to put those things on there.\n Yeah. You may not want to do that in a business. If you're working out of the home, having a home address would not be optimal. I would back off of that. But if you have a place of business, even if it's a sweet, a sweet number in a building, that's totally fine. Great. But put yourself in the mind of the consumer. They're just looking for these subtle signals of legitimacy, credibility. Are you real? Can I contact you? If I do want to contact you, are you going to make it really difficult?\n So all of these sound really good. If you have a company who's been in business for a long time and has a lot of reviews, what would you say to newer businesses who don't have years and years and, you know, thousands and thousands served? What are some of those proof points that we could point out that smaller businesses, newer businesses could lean on?\n Sure. So if you're a smaller business and you don't have obviously many years in business, you can get some testimonials from your clients. You can get case studies. For example, in your ad, read three case studies that reflect the success this product, you know, does or brings or offers. So case studies, testimonials, awards.\n So you might have an award from an industry or from a competition or whatever the case, even a better business bureau badge, member of the better business bureau, everybody and anybody can be a member of the better business bureau. And just having that little BBB badge creates trust member of the Lackawanna County chamber of commerce. Okay. That shows that you are part of the community. You're not hiding. You're not a vapor business here today, gone tomorrow, that you're creating you know, engagement in the business community. So BBB chamber of commerce costs very, very little to do, but they just do show what we call trust signals or trust badges and low hanging fruit.\n Yeah, this is fantastic. All right. So we've talked about how to leverage our current reviews. Can you tell us a little bit about how LinkedIn advertisers can build these reviews and where is it important for B to B to be building these reviews?\n Everybody can build reviews. So shopper approved collects reviews for B to B B to C doesn't matter. As long as you are able to buy something and check out on the website, we can fire a review request. If you're not selling something on the website and you can't actually check out, then there's a variety of other review platforms that you can use, but everybody should be collecting reviews and asking every single customer for a review. Because the best time to plant a shade tree is 10 years ago. If you didn't do it 10 years ago, do it today. So you can enjoy that benefit later, but start collecting reviews and not only collect reviews, but use the right review partner that will syndicate and display those reviews. Not only on your website, your homepage, your category page, your product pages, but also in organic and paid search results. So to do that, you need to be a Google review partner. So make sure that the review platform you're using is a Google and being review partner so that those review snippets show up in your Google ads, Bing ads, Google shopping, and organic search results, because that is part of the persuasion and that's a big part of reputation management. In other words, if your reviews only appear on your website, but they don't appear in your ads and organic search results, then people may never go to your website because they don't have the trust and credibility from the search results to even bother going to your website. Think of it this way. If you're doing a search for a product and let's say it's a business product, it's a computer, and you see four Google shopping listings for the same product. Three of them have review stars and ratings and one doesn't. One of them has a 4.7. The other one has a 3.2 of those, which are you going to click on and what you're going to not click on.\n Yeah. You're never going to click on the one that doesn't have anything and you're definitely going to click on the one that has the highest.\n Exactly. And not only the highest, but what the research also shows is that people want to see more reviews. So for example, a 4.5 average star rating with 3000 reviews, many times will outperform a 4.7 with six reviews.\n Wow.\n Social proof.\n Because the assumption is that is much, much more difficult to game or manipulate thousands or hundreds of reviews than it is a handful.\n Makes perfect sense.\n So you really do want to collect as many reviews as possible and start as soon as possible. So you can build up those reviews because the number of reviews is analogous to a long line of the restaurant, right? Popularity. If you only have three or four reviews, really? Is that your cousin, brother and uncle?\n Right. Pretty easy to engineer for.\n Exactly.\n I would say the majority of our clients and probably the majority of listeners are probably SAS software, which makes sense. There there's actually going to be a purchase in there somewhere. So this makes sense for those who don't, maybe they are working specifically with a sales rep, they ink a deal there. Maybe it's more of a service, less of a product. At what point do you suggest asking for the review?\n She always asks review. It's just like asking for a testimonial or a referral. If you are B2B and you're SAS G2 Captera, great platforms. And you can ask people to leave a review on G2 and or Captera just as you can on any other open review platform like Trustpilot or BBB for that matter. BBB is actually an open review platform. So you can ask people, you can send them a link say, Hey, would you mind sending me a review to this review platform? And you can, they can just click that link and go to that platform and leave a review.\n And do you suggest asking for the review as they are signing as they're purchasing or after they've gotten a chance to use the product for a little while, cause I could see someone saying like, I will leave you a review, but I haven't even had a chance to test your product yet.\n Yeah, great question. So there's two types of reviews. If you're an online seller and you have an e-commerce store, there's what they call seller ratings or store reviews, and that's a Google product. And that's a review on your experience with the website. There's also a product review, and that is obviously for the product you bought. So we collect both seller ratings or store reviews, which show up in your Google shopping and your Google ads and your organic search results and on your website and product reviews. So you can review abc.com and the product XYZ widget, and therefore you're getting two reviews. Now, if you've noticed in Google shopping lately, you'll see oftentimes, depending if the store is collecting both a seller rating or a store rating and a product review, now that seller rating is what shows up in the Google trusted store icon. And that's what's powering that Google trusted store icon is the seller rating and the product reviews and for the products. So back to your question, if you're selling products, but you're not an e-commerce store, then yes, give them, you know, a week to get the product, use the product, and then ask for a review.\n Oh, that's gold.\n I recommend following up with text wherever possible because text gets opened at 99% of the time, whereas emails, depending on the familiarity with the brand, et cetera, you might get a 10% open rate. You might get a 15% open rate, but you're never going to get the same open rate as you do with text. No secret. We did. I'm not going to name the brand, but I was CMO of a national franchise and we had 200 locations in 34 States.\n And what we did, it was a brick and mortar franchise, but the majority of the leads came through the website. And so what we did was when we sold the product to the customer at the brick and mortar location, we asked Jim, do you mind leaving us a review? Not at all. Wonderful. Can I send you a text? Absolutely. What's your number? And they would put it in right then and there while the customer is still in the store, they would receive it and they would leave the review before they even left. Why is that important? Because we know that if you ask people in the moment while they're there, the chance of them actually doing the review are virtually a hundred percent. If you do it later, it goes down, but it's that heat of the moment. So, you know, that's the time to ask for review if they're in a store location or you're on the phone with them. And I've had this happen to me before people say, Hey, you know, great doing business. We're at a zoom call or on the phone. Would you mind leaving us your view? Not at all. Can I send you a review request? Absolutely. What's your number?\n Boom. There you go. So that's another way to really increase your review conversion rate.\n That's amazing. So if you have a sales rep who's dealing specifically with someone before they even hop off, give them the same thing.\n Yeah.\n Do you mind reviewing us? Can I send you a text?\n Yeah.\n Oh, that's gold right there.\n Do it in the moment if you can, because then, you know, like I say, the conversion rate is virtually a hundred percent.\n Perfect. I know this is going to be a little bit of a loaded question because you sell a product like this, but how does someone go and get some sort of a review platform that allows them to push a review, ask right to someone's cell phone number?\n Yeah. There's many review platforms. You can look at Vindasta. You can look at trust pilot. You can look at podium podiums, a great one. There's many.\n And we should mention shopper approved, right?\n Cause it's absolutely without saying there.\n So we won't hide the fact that you have a platform that does this. And that would be my recommendation.\n Yeah. If shopper approved, I mean, yeah, we've been talking about shopper approved. We, like I say, about a quarter of our businesses B to B and we are actually the highest rated review platform on the web through G2, Captera, even our competitors, trust pilot on BBB, Google, et cetera. We've been in business since 2010. We're a Google and Bing review partner. And we have the highest review request conversion rate in the business. And we're proud of that. And again, we collect seller and product reviews. And we also collect video reviews. And video reviews are super important because now you've got that customer on camera talking about either their product experience or their experience with the website, and that's much more convincing because you're looking at a human being versus just text.\n Yeah. For those of you who are listening, you heard how hard it was for me to pull out of DJ the opportunity to plug his own product. That was one thing I absolutely loved about his book is it struck me. He was mentioning his competitors just as often, if not more often than his own product. So DJ, I love how non-pushy you are. And it comes through so authentically in the book. So just hat tip to you for that. That's amazing.\n Well, thank you. We, we wrote the book because we wanted to be absolutely transparent and we really wanted to just explain how the reputation industry works and how reviews work, how they're collected, how they're displayed, where they're displayed, how to collect them, when to collect them, the tools to collect them, and really the strategy behind reputation management, not just a list of tools, but really how it works. And you read the book, so you know how deeply we get into strategy and how to create and amplify your brand and your reputation online in paid and organic search results, as well as your website. Because what we really want to do is talk clearly to the executive, to the C-suite and explain how important it is to own and manage and amplify your own reputation. So we really want to be transparent and authentic and just say, here's what it is, make your decisions, but here are the best strategies. And here's what we recommend.\n I love it. And I will definitely recommend reading the book right here at the end. I'm going to tell you exactly how you can go and get your free digital copy or audio book audio, because admittedly how I consumed it. I love audio as all of you as podcast listeners, I'm sure you'll appreciate it. So stick around for just a few more minutes and we'll get you that DJ. Can you share any examples of how reputation management has helped B2B companies?\n Absolutely. So we have one client that had a pretty flat traffic over five years on their website. It was not growing. And then in June, they added our reviews to their website. They were capturing seller and product reviews. And then in the following month, they added our search optimized AI driven Q and A tool. And what the Q and A tool does is it automatically optimizes your product questions and answers for page one search results. So for example, if somebody is asking the question in Google, does the ABC widget float, is the ABC widget waterproof? Does the ABC widget work with the XYZ product? Well, those are very low funnel, high purchase, and 10 search questions. So by optimizing those questions and answers for the featured snippet and page one specifically,\n their traffic went up, believe it or not, 8,000%. And their conversions went up 400%. Why? Because we're combining social proof, ratings and reviews with questions and answers. We're actually making it very easy and fast for the consumer to get their very specific product questions answered both in search and on the website.\n So by doing that, what you've done is you've removed the friction. They no longer have to think, can I trust this website? Can I trust this product? Because we have the reviews and they don't have to wonder, is this going to work for me? Is this the product that I'm looking for? Because your questions are all answered on the website using the Q and A widget and in search using the Google search bar. So does it work? Absolutely. Because at the end of the day, why do we go to Google? Because we have questions. We're looking for answers. We're looking for solutions. We're looking for brands, products, right? We're looking for something to scratch that itch or answer that question. And if we can scratch that itch and answer that question both in search and on the website and make it super fast and super easy to do so, then it goes without saying you're going to get more traffic and more conversions.\n I love it. Thanks so much for sharing that. All right. So the question that I ask everyone I interview, because I really want to know what drives you and what fires you up. Tell us what are you most excited about professionally? And then I'm going to follow up immediately with what are you most excited about personally?\n Okay. Good questions. So professionally, obviously the book reputation King is such a exciting project for me because it's the first and only book written specifically for e-commerce and specifically on reputation management.\n And that has guarded so many positive reviews and so many people saying, wow, I finally get it. I understand the veil has been lifted. I know how this industry works and I know how to build and display a positive reputation, but going into next year, what I'm really excited about is we're building out a community for e-commerce executives where we can help them work with their peers and experts to help grow their business in a variety of ways, traffic conversions, net profits, gross revenue, et cetera. And so we're crafting this really exciting community. We're going to bring in subject matter experts, authors, practitioners, and peers to share knowledge and strategies within the e-commerce community. That's what I'm excited about professionally.\n So cool. And what about personally?\n Personally, I love international travel and planning a trip to Thailand. So excited about that.\n That's pretty amazing. You'll have to let me know how Thailand is because I've never stepped foot on the Asian continent.\n Okay. Well, I was there in 2010 and loved it. Absolutely loved it. It haven't been back since it's been 14 years and he started to go back.\n Love it. Well, DJ, thank you so much for sharing so much value with us today. For those of you who want a free copy of the book, go to reputationking.com. Click the link that says, get me my free copy and you'll have access to it. The same audio book that I listened to and absolutely loved. So check that out.

We'll put all these links right down there in the show notes. So if you're listening to this, just scroll down, check it out. DJ, thank you so much. Is there anything else that you want to impart to us before we bail?\n Think about your reputation as part of your traffic and your conversion equation, because it works in both ways. A positive visible online reputation drives traffic and it also drives revenue and conversions. So don't look over it. Don't gloss over it. Don't think it's a little thing. It's actually a huge thing. And get the book. And by the way, we have this for sale is a hardcover full color version on the website, it's 1995 shipping and handling. You get the book, you get the strategy guide, you get this really cool gold million dollar bill, as I know your kids loved.\n My kids love the golden bill.\n And some other little goodies. It's worth 10 times more than that. And, uh, I just invite you to get the book and delve into this. I think very exciting topic, reputation management.\n And I can second that unboxing the book felt way more special than anything else I've ever unboxed before. So that was an amazing experience. Way to go engineering that.\n Thank you.\n That being said, thanks so much for joining us today and we will send everyone your way and reach out if I can ever be useful or helpful in any way.\n Thanks, AJ.\n All right. Thanks, DJ.\n All right, LinkedIn fanatics. I hope you love the conversation with DJ as much as I did.

If you've struggled with converting cold traffic into sales-ready leads, this episode walks you through how to build a multi-stage funnel using LinkedIn Ads retargeting features.\nKey Discussion Points:\nWhy Cold Audiences Need Nurturing:\nMost cold audiences (95%) aren’t ready to engage with sales reps or bottom-of-funnel offers.\nNurturing involves multiple retargeting stages to move prospects down the funnel, warming them up to higher-friction calls to action.\nBuilding a Multi-Stage Funnel:\nStage 1 (Cold Traffic):\n Use LinkedIn’s native audience targeting to reach cold audiences who align with your ideal customer profile.\nStage 2 (First Retargeting):\n Retarget website visitors, company page visitors, and ad engagers from Stage 1. Apply targeting \"guardrails\" like seniority, job function, or industry to refine the audience.\nStage 3 (Hot Traffic):\n Retarget prospects from Stage 2 who have engaged meaningfully. These are primed for bottom-of-funnel offers like demos or sales calls.\nBest Practices for Funnel Organization:\nUse a campaign naming convention like S01, S02, S03 to clearly identify funnel stages in your account and ensure they’re sorted alphabetically.\nExclude retargeting audiences from the previous stage to avoid overlap and ensure prospects graduate down the funnel.\nRetargeting Audience Management:\nCreate retargeting audiences based on specific engagements (e.g., video views, document interactions).\nCombine smaller audiences (e.g., website visitors + company page visitors) to ensure they hit the 300-member minimum for ads to serve.\nBudget Considerations:\nA multi-stage funnel works best with a monthly budget of $5,000 or more, though smaller budgets are possible with longer ramp-up times.\nTesting and Optimization:\nRun bottom-of-funnel offers in earlier stages as a test to gauge audience readiness.\nIf Stage 3 doesn’t yield high conversion rates, adjust ad messaging to clearly communicate value and reduce friction.\nRecent LinkedIn Updates:\nLinkedIn Wire Beta:\n Advertise as pre-roll videos on high-trust publisher content like Bloomberg and Forbes.\nHoliday Ad Tips:\n Lower competition during the holidays results in reduced CPCs and CPLs, making it an opportune time to run campaigns.\nPro Tips:\nTake advantage of seasonal or holiday-themed campaigns for better engagement.\nUse organic posts from company representatives to complement paid ads, especially during events.\nCall to Action:\n Join the LinkedIn Ads Fanatics community for access to expert insights, courses, and weekly group calls with AJ.

We're covering the nurturing steps to prep cold traffic on this week's episode of the LinkedIn Ads Show.\n Welcome to the LinkedIn Ads Show. Here's your host, AJ Wilcox.\n Hey, hey, hey there LinkedIn Ads fanatics. As he said, I'm AJ Wilcox. I'm the host of the weekly podcast, the LinkedIn Ads Show. I'm thrilled to welcome you to the show for advanced B2B marketers who want to evolve their craft, master LinkedIn Ads, and achieve true pro status. I said it in the teaser that cold audiences aren't ready to talk to your sales rep. I would say that applies to about 95% of you because we usually see about 5% of accounts that for whatever reason, it's usually extreme value that they're giving or pent up demand. Either way, there's a small percentage of companies out there who may be able to go right for the kill. They may not have to nurture quite as much, but the vast majority of you will need to nurture sometimes with several touches before you see great conversion rates for your demo focused calls to action ads or free trials or whatever bottom of the funnel kinds of ask that you're using. So if we can't have success pushing demos and sales calls right to a cold audience, what are we to do? Well, this is done through retargeting and usually like I said, multiple stages of it. LinkedIn does make it really easy to create retargeting audiences. And I will say the retargeting audiences that we can build on LinkedIn are one of the few things where LinkedIn is way ahead of meta and Google on. They've given us so many options and I hope in the future we have a lot more as well because there's so much more information that LinkedIn has. So it's easy to create these retargeting audiences, but it doesn't make it very easy to build advanced campaign structures and build multiple funnel stages and graduate those prospects down the funnel. So I'm going to walk you through in today's episode exactly how with LinkedIn ads to create a multi-stage funnel and graduate your prospects down from cold traffic to where they are red hot.\n The LinkedIn Ads Show is proudly brought to you by B2Linked.com.

First off in the news at the time of recording, I'm just about to head to Boston to speak at the marketing profs B2B forum event. This is a really cool conference. B2B doesn't get a whole lot of love in the conference circuit, but marketing profs, they're a B2B organization to the core. They totally know how to give it to us in the best way. So this episode is not going to go live until after that event is over. So I'm really hopeful that I get to meet many of you LinkedIn ads fanatics there. Then next week I'm speaking at Heroconf. It's the advanced PPC conference in San Diego, California. So if you're a listener, you hear this first, make sure to come say hi. I'd love to hang out. I do hope to get another episode out next week, but you know how it goes when you're traveling. I can't exactly take this mic with me, so I'm crossing my fingers. I can get it done in between travel. I want to call out a new upcoming feature and this is called LinkedIn wire. This was shared with me by Paula Merrick, one of my favorite LinkedIn reps. She shared with me all about the wire program. I was really excited to share it with you. We'll probably end up doing a full episode on this when it comes out or when I get some experience. But for right now, here's the scoop. LinkedIn's currently testing a program that is in beta right now that's going to allow brands to advertise on the videos of really highly trusted publishers. So imagine like Bloomberg, Business Insider, Wall Street Journal, when they have great video content in the news feed that people are watching, we'll be able to have our LinkedIn ads as a pre-roll video to these that we pay for. We'll still get our own targeting that we love LinkedIn so much for. It's going to be right in the members feeds, which is exactly where we want our sponsored content. It seems like a great program. And I do think that halo effect that you get by being featured on videos from really well-known publishers is going to make your brand look even better. Now, these aren't ads that you can purchase on a self-service basis right within campaign manager yourself. No, you actually need to go to your LinkedIn rep. Your LinkedIn rep will be able to sell publisher content packages for the wire and you're only eligible if you've been nominated. So new accounts that want to get in here, talk to your LinkedIn reps, see if they can push you through that nomination process. During the beta, they're just working with a small group of publishers. We did notice that the US postal service ran an ad there. So others like that, I'm guessing Fortune 500s or quite large enterprises. And to qualify for the wire beta right now, they want you to set aside a minimum of $50,000 per campaign for the lifetime. I mentioned a couple publishers there, but we have Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, Market Watch, Barons, Business Insider, Reuters,\n Forbes, Fortune, NBCU, and Yahoo Finance. Looks pretty cool. Any of you who have the budgets to participate in this, I would absolutely love to hear about the results. Around this time of year, lots of your LinkedIn reps will reach out to you asking what your plans are for the holidays. Lots of advertisers like to pause their ads during the holidays because it's like, well, if we don't have sales reps who are in the office ready to field calls or ready to do demos, why would we waste the money? This actually creates a really cool effect because since so many advertisers are pausing their accounts, what it means is costs overall for those who don't pause, they're going to get lower costs. LinkedIn last year saw a drop during the holidays. I'm going to guess that this was Christmas through New Year's in North America, but they saw a decreased cost per click by 11.6%. That drove a lower cost per lead by four and a half percent. They mentioned that there is a drop in engagement rates on average about one and a half percent, but I've actually noticed that on holidays, we actually see higher engagement, lower volume because not as many people are spending time on LinkedIn, but higher engagement because the ones who are, they're under a lot less stress, their calendars are free, and you have more of their attention. But if LinkedIn says that engagement dropped by one and a half percent, okay, I'll believe them, but I've seen the opposite. And absolutely, you can take full advantage of these performance increases, especially if you tailor your creative to speak to the holiday. Having a seasonal event or a holiday promotion, something where you can at least call out the elephant in the room that like, \"Hey, you're on your phone on Christmas.\" These can really boost your engagement and visibility. All right, if you have a question for me to answer here on the show, if you would love to leave a review because I would love you for it, or if you want to leave feedback for the show, send a message to me on LinkedIn. My DMs are free and open. You can also email us at podcast at B2Linked.com. If you attach a link to a voice recording, I'll play you right here on the show and shout you out. Or if you want to just leave me dumb text, okay, I can read it myself. As always, I want to feature you. All right, without further ado, let's hit it. I've been getting more and more questions lately about how to do full funnel retargeting campaigns. It's actually pretty hard to do the way that LinkedIn has built their tools, which is really surprising because LinkedIn actually bought a company years ago called Bizzo, and they did exactly this. You could build campaigns that would automatically target someone at one funnel stage and move them down. And LinkedIn would keep track of everyone that they were showing these ads to, and you could show them in a specific sequence and at special stages. And it was really surprising LinkedIn actually shut Bizzo down. That was actually the announcement that tanks the price of LinkedIn stock, which allowed Microsoft to swoop in and purchase it. So you can thank shutting down of Bizzo to why LinkedIn is now a Microsoft property. Okay, but that's a conversation for another day. I want to shout out Sarah Clancy, who's in the LinkedIn ads fanatics community. She brought this question up this week and made me realize that I haven't talked much about this in a past episode. I already gave the LinkedIn ads fanatics this insight earlier. So if you are a LinkedIn ads one percenter or want to be, make sure you're a member of the LinkedIn ads fanatics community. Go to fanatics.B2Linked.com. All right, to build a multi stage funnel. First, you need to decide how to name your campaigns so that you have a nice, easy to understand organization. I used to name all of my campaigns by putting tofu, mofu, or bofu in front of them. That's tofu for top of funnel, mofu. I wish it was mofo for middle of funnel and bofu for bottom of funnel. And that would allow me to separate out all my campaigns by stages, but that convention had two major limitations. The first is that tofu, mofu, and bofu, they're not in the right order alphabetically. So I found it actually really difficult in large accounts to quickly sort and look at performance. The second big limitation is what if you want to build a funnel that has more than three stages? What was I going to call these additional stages? Like I considered adding extra Bs to the name of it. So it's B Bofu and B B Bofu. But ultimately, I didn't like that. So to solve this, I started adding S01, S02, S03 to the front of my campaign names. The S stands for stage. So we're doing stage one, stage two, and stage three. This helped me to be really organized in my campaign naming. And since they all start with the letter S and then have numbers that count up like S01, S02, when LinkedIn will naturally sort them or when Excel sorts them alphabetically, it keeps all of your stages nicely together. And plus, I get an unlimited number of stages. Problem solved. I will mention we just launched a particularly large account that has six stages. So I'm really appreciating the simplicity of this naming. Stage one is our cold stage. This is where we're relying on LinkedIn's native audience targeting to define the audiences that we just can't reach on any other channel. This is where LinkedIn shines.\n Stage two, this is our first retargeting stage. This is where I target a few different groups to begin with. Number one, I target website retargeting audiences, but I won't run just the website retargeting audience on its own. I put what I call guardrails on the targeting since not all of your website visitors are going to make good potential customers. For instance, someone who is looking to be hired by you looking for a job, they're going to come visit your website. Also, salespeople who are trying to sell into your company, they're spending time on your website researching and learning more about you. So I like to apply some broad targeting that chances are they're going to make a decent customer. So I apply these broad targetings like job function, level of seniority, company size, sometimes I'll use industry. So website retargeting audiences, I push them right into stage two. Another audience that I push right into stage two, these are my LinkedIn company page visitors. I put guardrails on these for exactly the same reason as website visits retargeting. So those are two potential stage two campaigns already. Then the third campaign I like to include by default, these are those who've interacted with my stage one ads. So if I'm running thought leader ads in my stage one, it'll be either single image ad, engagers, or 50% video viewers, just depending on whether it's single image or video. If I'm running document ads in stage one, it'll be document engagers, you get the point. Basically match your retargeting type to whatever type of ads that you're running in your stage one. Now here's the trick. You're going to create these retargeting audiences before you create your stage two campaigns. Because you have to, you have to have the audience to add to your campaign. What you need to remember is to make sure you exclude these retargeting audiences that you just created from your stage one campaigns. That's because as soon as someone engages with your stage one, you no longer want them to be targeted in stage one. You want to graduate them down to your stage two. It's annoying, but trust me, just make it a habit for every time you create a new audience. Now you might be asking yourself, when do we create these retargeting audiences? Because you know that your campaign isn't eligible to run until your retargeting audience has at least 300 people in it. That's true, but it actually doesn't have to stop you from creating your stage two campaigns all at the same time that you create your stage one campaigns. The reason for this is you can create everything. You can create your stage two campaigns, you can create the retargeting audiences that are based off of stage one's engagements. You can do all of this way before the campaign set live. If you set the campaign live, it's just not going to start serving your ads actively until that audience gets right over that 300 person mark, but then it's going to immediately start serving. So I don't suggest waiting at all to create any of your funnel stages unless you're waiting on some kind of content for them. Now, if it's taking a long time to get your retargeting audiences to be large enough to actually run, you can always combine multiple retargeting audiences together. For instance, in stage two, I mentioned that I'll have website visits retargeting with guardrails and LinkedIn company page visitors with guardrails. A lot of times I'll actually smush both of those audiences together into a single retargeting campaign. And what's cool about this is the campaign is going to start serving impressions as soon as the combined audiences are over 300. So if I only have 100 people in my website visits retargeting, but 200 people have visited my LinkedIn company page when they're combined together, I hit 300 and my ads start serving. So now that I have stage two campaigns created and serving, we're going to follow exactly the same steps as before. We're going to create retargeting audiences from the meaningful interactions from those stage two campaigns. And then we're going to remember to exclude those audiences immediately from our stage two campaigns. So stage two campaign creates the audience and then immediately excludes it. Now the same audiences that you just excluded from stage two, you take those to actually target to create your stage three campaigns. It's hard to explain this verbally, but I really hope you're catching on because this is super important. Otherwise your prospects are going to continue to be targeted by both your stage two and your stage three campaigns. So they're going to be cannibalizing each other's impressions. Oftentimes I notice obviously stage one runs immediately because these are cold audiences. It may take a few days or a week to get stage two running. From my experience, stage three campaigns tend to take longer before they're large enough to run. So that means that when you're a stage three prospect, you've interacted with at least two ads before at this point, the brand has earned more of your attention. This stage three audience is who is going to be a lot more open to an offer like meeting with sales or signing up for a free trial or whatever your bottom of funnel high friction conversion is. If you present a bottom of the funnel offer to those in stage three and they still don't have a high conversion rate, that's a clue that you might need to either add additional stages of nurture or maybe your ads aren't attractive enough. And I don't mean that they're not pretty enough or eye-catching enough. What you want is when you're explaining to someone why they should meet with your sales rep, you need to tell them here is the value you're going to get out of it. Concretely explain the value, de-emphasize any sort of friction and try that first before you decide to add additional funnel stages. How much budget do you need to run a multi-stage funnel? I would suggest that you'd probably want to have about a five thousand dollar a month budget at least, but it's certainly possible with less. You might just notice that it takes a long time until your stage three campaigns are large enough to serve at any meaningful volume. Just for funsies, I like to try running bottom of the funnel offers in stage one and I also like running them in stage two on my way to building stage three. This is just a test, but if it so happens that your audience is primed and ready for a meaningful conversation with sales without having to be passed through two previous stages, then that's awesome. You can save some money right there by going right for the kill. But normally you're going to see really high conversion costs until you get them to stage three.\nI mentioned before the LinkedIn ads fanatics community sign up and for one low monthly cost, you get access to all of the community of LinkedIn ads experts who are all sharing what's working for them.

As he said, I'm AJ Wilcox. I'm the host of the weekly podcast, the LinkedIn Ads Show. I'm thrilled to welcome you to the show for advanced B2B marketers in their evolution of mastering LinkedIn Ads and achieving true pro status. As long as LinkedIn Ads have existed, it's had a perception problem. LinkedIn Ads has always been one of the most expensive ad platforms out there. LinkedIn definitely recognized this and internally they knew that their business targeting blows every other channel out of the water when it comes to quality. But it had to wait for advertisers to come around. This has caused very slow growth for the LinkedIn Ads platform. For years, B2B marketers who should have been investing in LinkedIn, heard things like, \" LinkedIn Ads are too expensive and they don't work and they have very limited features and are behind all the other platforms.\" So they continued to hunt for all of their traffic elsewhere. At some point though, since LinkedIn really is the only game in town when you need tight granularity of targeting, marketers would end up giving it another shot and bringing some test budgets to LinkedIn. As marketers have gotten more sophisticated at measuring their traffic and they have better tools at their fingertips, they see the performance from their LinkedIn Ads traffic and they realize that there's value there and they start to bring more investment. Obviously, I don't know the specifics, but I can tell you that over the last 14 years that I've been watching LinkedIn Ads, I've watched this organic growth happen. Very slowly, but moving in the right direction. Then in the last three years, I've seen what appears to be exponential attention and adoption from B2B marketers to the LinkedIn Ads platform. I've given this feedback to anyone at LinkedIn who would listen to me that growth is not going to come from competing on price, but by capitalizing on what LinkedIn Ads does best in the world. And that is targeting and traffic quality. And the traffic quality is exceptionally difficult to quantify. So LinkedIn should be making huge investments into measurement and attribution tools.\n Essentially, LinkedIn's job has been to prove to advertisers that the traffic is valuable and they should stop worrying so much about the price. I'm happy to report that LinkedIn has come around on this line of thinking and has been releasing some big advancements in measurement. On today's episode, we're diving into the new measurement insights tool that's being rolled out right now. You might even have access to it as we speak. We'll talk about what the tool can teach you about your campaigns and how to use it. It's exciting stuff.\n That's right. B2LINKED is the ad agency, 100% dedicated to LinkedIn ads.

You get to work directly with me and my local team, and you won't get any sort of cookie cutter approach or standard account templates from us.

If you attach a link to a voice recording from you, I can include you right here on the show and play it for everyone. And as always, I'm happy to keep you anonymous or share your details as well. Hit me up because I want to feature you. All right, without further ado, let's hit it.\n I've mentioned one of my favorite ever LinkedIn reps, Paola Merrick on the show before. And I had some questions about the new measurement insights tool, and she hooked me up with so many insights about it. So Paola, a huge thank you for hooking me up. So starting on October 28th, LinkedIn started to roll out this new tool. I would estimate that about half of the accounts that we have access to it right now. So it's probably on like a two to two and a half month rollout period. If you go log in to your campaign manager, you can tell that whether you have it or not, if you look in your left hand navigation, if it no longer says analyze, and now it says measurement instead, you'll know that you have access underneath measurement, you can click insights. LinkedIn calls it the insights hub, and it says it will provide users with actionable member company campaign and ad level insights to improve overall business impact. When you very first enter your measurement insights, you'll see that you have a time range, it's defaulted to the last 90 days, but you can change that and customize it however you'd like. You'll also see a chart and above the chart, you have three buckets that you can customize everything on the report from. One bucket is awareness, the next is consideration. The third is conversion. There is a fourth bucket called revenue, but we'll get to that one next. So you'll notice that these buckets, they correlate to stages in the objectives in campaign manager, and this is for good reason. LinkedIn is going to attempt to show you your campaign performance by stage of the funnel, but since LinkedIn doesn't actually know which campaigns are assigned to each funnel stage, it decided to bucket them by objective. I guess this is the best they do, but for me the assumption won't ever work. For instance, the only objective under awareness that it calculates is brand awareness, and as many of you may know, I won't touch what I call the most expensive objective brand awareness with a 10-foot pole, unless I'm running CTV because that's the only option. So LinkedIn is never going to show me any performance at the awareness stage, despite the fact that I have lots of cold stage awareness campaigns running. In fact, I have more cold stage campaigns running than any other stage of the funnel. That's why funnels look the way they do where they're bigger on top. So what I recommend is using whichever objective gets you the same or better attention for the price, and for me sometimes that means like using website visits objective to cold audiences or using brand awareness objective on like bottom of funnel, but this is the way that LinkedIn rolled it out. I get it. I'll digress. So that's the awareness bucket. I've come to understand that I'm just never going to have anything in that bucket, and that's okay. The next stage over though is consideration stage, and this includes any campaigns that are using the engagement, video views, or website visits objectives. Then you have your conversion stage. This includes all of your campaigns that are in lead generation, talent leads, website conversions, and job applicants. Now the fourth bucket that's called revenue, this is really smart. It pulls in data from your CRM to show the impact of your LinkedIn ads on your actual revenue or your actual sales process. So now right underneath these funnel stages you'll see a chart. It's called performance, and I think it is the most helpful chart that we've ever gotten from LinkedIn. It plots your ad performance as a line chart over whatever time range you've set, and it allows you to layer up to three metrics on top of each other. It's basically what the campaign manager's performance chart wants to be when it grows up. It's a bit limited in what it can display and how it can display it. You can chart impressions, reach, dwell time, click-through rate, chargeable clicks, website visits, video views, cost per click, number of leads, cost per lead, qualified leads, and cost per qualified lead. And for any of those metrics you can compare them side by side, and the third metric you can always overlay spend on top. But here's the kicker, as helpful as this chart is you can't drill in deeper. It's all data based on the whole account. It would be amazing if I could drill into specific campaigns or ads with this, but we're kind of stuck with an overview, so I'll get used to that. The next chart says companies funnel analysis. This is where you can see the number of companies that are located in each of your specific marketing stages over the past 180 days. So what it does is it takes the total number of companies that are part of your accounts targeting, and it calculates the number in each funnel stage. So this breaks your companies down by the same funnel, but it's a different definition, so pay close attention here. We have the same awareness, consideration, and leads, but now rather than relying on the companies that are being targeted in each of your objectives, now LinkedIn is actually applying some intelligence in understanding which of these companies should fit in your awareness, meaning they haven't really engaged with you yet, which ones are sitting under consideration, meaning they've engaged with you a good bit, and then which one are leads. And you will have the same company oftentimes being targeted in multiple stages of your funnel. LinkedIn understands this, so each company is actually being calculated once across the funnel based on the employee's actions at the lowest step of the funnel. So let's say for instance that you're reaching Sherry in marketing at one company, and then at the same company you're also reaching Debbie. If Sherry hasn't engaged yet, she would still be under awareness, and Debbie has engaged with your ads, so she might be under consideration. So LinkedIn's only going to show us that same company once across the stages, so they're going to put the entire company under consideration because one of their employees has been engaging. Plus it'll also add into the chart here qualified leads, opportunities, and closed one if you've connected your CRM to it. And the definition that LinkedIn uses for awareness here I really like, as opposed to the definition before by objective. It's tallying these companies by the interactions that they're doing that actually make sense. And I'm certain it's using AI to do this, which is great. We don't need humans behind the scenes tallying these up and putting them in different columns. AI can do that just fine. The third chart down, this is called top performing audiences. Right underneath it it says, \"Understand which members and companies are engaging with your marketing efforts.\" It's using AI to find specific segments of your targeting that are performing better than others. And there's a toggle there. You can choose between if you want to see information about individuals or companies. It defaults to individuals and it calls this members attributes. In the account that I'm looking at it suggested two seniorities that were performing particularly well in both phases of the funnel, the consideration and conversion stages. So that's with seniorities toggled. And then there are two other options. You can also flip over to job functions and locations as well. So it'll show you the best performing job functions as well as the best performing locations. If you flip that toggle from members attributes down to companies attributes, then it's going to start showing you the company's names that are performing best at each stage of the funnel. This is only picking a single company name. So I don't find it all that helpful, but it is cool. I think to see one company that's particularly doing well, it's probably going to make you say, \"Hey, I should probably pass this company name over to my sales team.\" So they are giving them extra special attention or whatever. The other two toggles you have here are company size and industry. So you can, again, at each stage of the funnel that you have data for, it'll tell you the top performer in each of those segments. What's interesting to me is you can drill down on a suggestion. So it's telling me that under consideration, the director seniority is doing best. And if I click on that, there's a little explore as I hover over it. It then reloads the report and filters the entire report that I'm looking at by funnel stage. And so if I click the one that was in the consideration stage, the entire report gets filtered for the consideration stage of the funnel, which is interesting. I clicked on director because I want to see more about directors and it didn't. It just showed me the entire report just for this stage of the funnel. Kind of odd. This is the same behavior that if you go to the very top and you click on one of those funnel stages, that's what it's doing is it's redoing the whole report, recalculating based off of which funnel stage you want to look at. So again, you can't drill down to specific campaigns or ads, but you can drill down to the grouping of objectives. Not super helpful to me, but I'd suggest play around with it. See if you find a report or anything that brings you some actionable value. The next chart is called top performing ads. It says these ads received the highest key results at each campaign objective. It shows the top performing ad in each stage of the funnel with some simple metrics. There's number of key results. There's cost per key result, cost per click and click through rate. LinkedIn's definition of top performing is anything that drove the highest number of whatever your objective is. So in the lead gen objective, if there's one ad that drove 15 leads and another one that drove 10 leads, it doesn't matter if the one that drove 10 leads was at a much lower cost per lead and was much more efficient. LinkedIn's only going to show you the one that drove the highest number of leads. This goes a little bit counter to what I teach, which is try to find what is going to generate the most efficiency to get the highest number of leads, highest number of conversions out of your budget. That's okay. As long as you understand what LinkedIn's definition is here, you'll know how to interpret the data. And then the last section here says top performing campaigns. There's a little note that says these campaigns receive the highest key result at each campaign objective. And again, because I don't have anything in the brand awareness objective for this account, I'm only seeing consideration and conversion, but it's going to show me the top campaign for each of those with some simple metrics. So I see number of key results, costs per key result, cost per click, click through rate. And depending on the time range you choose, sometimes you'll get an extra column there called daily delivery. It looks like this is actually what I would consider average daily spend, but watch out because if your ad didn't run for the whole time period that you're analyzing, the daily average is going to be off since LinkedIn is actually dividing the total spend over the number of days in your timeframe. It's not dividing it by the number of days that the campaign actually ran. That's something I wish LinkedIn would adjust. And this also has the same issue with LinkedIn's definition of top performing being different than mine. But I do hope that because this is AI driven, that the AI is going to be smart enough to say, yeah, the campaign that drove the highest number of leads or the most clicks is probably not super important compared to another campaign that is a lot more efficient and seems to be ramping up over time. So this report is cool, but the thing that I geeked out the most on this is how is LinkedIn actually calculating all this? Because there's a lot going on behind the scenes. What's happening here is really cool from a data perspective. During this 180 day look back window, the measurement insights tool is collecting the last 50 touch points. That's impressions and clicks of your campaigns, of your advertiser campaigns with each member of your target audience. And then it's determining the allocation of all of those touch points across the funnel. It's starting this with looking at just the interactions within the LinkedIn ecosystem for all of these touch points, especially those that signal a higher likelihood of conversion. The model is considering all campaigns run by an advertiser and it's learning patterns using the data across advertisers. It also takes those 50 last touches for each member and it allocates the credit for conversions across all of those interactions. It's analyzing by things like your campaign type, your objective, the number of days before conversion actually occurred, your member data, including what company they represent and your advertiser data, including the company. Every advertiser is probably going to have a different attribution model that they care about. So LinkedIn's model is specific just to the data available on LinkedIn. So you can continue to use whatever attribution you are using and modeling on your side. This is just going to show you how LinkedIn sees it. And those are good to compare. I found the report really interesting to look at, but I honestly haven't found it to be exceptionally actionable. LinkedIn is going to keep improving this and providing a ton more insights. This is just the beginning. All of this to say, go check it out, see if you have the reports, play with it and give feedback to your LinkedIn ad reps on what you'd like to see improved and how it can better benefit you.

Was it true? I'm sharing the results of $185,000 of holiday ad spend on this week's episode of the LinkedIn Ads Show.\nWelcome to the LinkedIn Ads Show. Here's your host, AJ Wilcox.\n‍\nHey, hey, hey there LinkedIn Ads fanatics. As he said, I'm AJ Wilcox. I'm the host of the weekly podcast, the LinkedIn Ads Show. I'm thrilled to welcome you to the show for advanced B2B marketers who are trying to evolve and master their LinkedIn Ads craft and achieve true pro status. I hope you all had wonderful holidays. If you celebrated, I hope you had a blessed, peaceful Christmas. And happy new year. I wish to all of you that you only accidentally write 24 on your dates only three times instead of for two months like I usually do. \nAll right. So question for you. Did you run your LinkedIn Ads over the holidays or did you pause them? Lots of the advertisers I spoke to planned on pausing them, but I kept getting messages from LinkedIn reps practically begging us not to pause. So I compiled the performance results for many different ads accounts and over $185,000 in spend. And I'm walking you through my recommendations of whether you should pause over the holidays or listen to LinkedIn and leave them unpause to get better performance. \nThe LinkedIn Ads Show is proudly brought to you by B2LINKED.com.

And if you send a link to a voice recording from you, I'll get to play them right here on the show. I love to shout you out. \nAll right, without further ado, let's get to the topic at hand. Let's hit it. You may have gotten these two. I got a ton of emails from LinkedIn reps. They were saying something along the lines of, Hey, for the month of December, don't pause your ads because lots of B2B businesses pause their campaigns leading to less clutter in the ad space, which leads to lower costs per click for you and more visibility for your brand. And then they went on to talk about lots of other benefits to not pausing over the holidays. I totally see why LinkedIn would do this. They don't want us to pause our ads because they make less money. And so they want to convince us that we should keep our ads running over the holidays. When I've done deep data analysis about this in the past, I haven't found there to actually be better performance over the holidays. So I wanted to test this again this year. So here's my methodology for how I tested this. I collected all of the ad accounts that we manage that I knew didn't make any major changes across the holidays. So that way I could rule out any sort of human intervention or changes in the account. I pulled the data for all of these accounts by day, all the way from November 1st through January 2nd. Now the vast majority of the spend in these accounts was targeting North America, which is LinkedIn's most competitive market. So that means we should have seen swings due to the holidays much more clearly. The total spend of the accounts, like I mentioned in the intro was over $185,000 over this period. So it's not a small sample size. I looked at the performance on each of the major US holidays that was Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's. But I also compared the performance on the day before the holiday and then the day immediately after the holiday. And then just for fun, I also compared the metrics of the period in between Christmas and New Year's just to see if there was that whole week period where things may have lifted or fallen. This is a time where many people in the US take time off, LinkedIn employees included. So I thought this would be a really interesting look. I then compared all of those days specifically in their performance with the normal averages from November 1st until the holiday period started. And that became our baseline for what we judge all of the other metrics by. I broke the performance out by ad format and objective. Those seem to be the most interesting and the most telling. And I also calculated a bunch of custom metrics that I use to evaluate performance. For instance, instead of looking at just the normal click-through rate metric, I actually calculate a variant that I call link click-through rate. It's the combination of clicks to the landing page plus sponsored messaging clicks plus lead form opens. And I divide that by the impressions. This allows me to calculate the propensity of someone to click to a position where they can now convert. And this is the same metric across all different ad formats and all objectives. So I can use the same definition of a metric across everything. It's really cool. I also use the same definition of a link click to calculate a cost per link click. I find that to be a much more accurate measure across objectives for how much did I have to pay to put someone into a position where they can now convert. Now I found the most variants and the most interesting things by breaking them out by ad format. \nNow, for those of you who are watching on YouTube, you will see my eyes look over to reference specific metrics and I won't be making eye contact with you the whole time. That's because I actually want to share with you the real metrics. All right, here we go. Single image ads. What we noticed is that engagement rates dropped across the board over the holidays. The baseline engagement rate was 0.87% and then all of the holidays, the before, during, after, and the between holidays, they were all significantly lower. They were between about 0.75 to 0.8%. So significantly less of an engagement rate, which definitely tells me that people during the holidays are less engaged. I also looked at link click through rate here because yes, they were engaging with ads less, but what if they were more likely to click on something that could then put them in a position to convert. And this kind of surprised me. Link click through rates only slightly. They did increase during our holiday times. Our average normal was 0.34% on a link click through rate basis, where in the holiday periods, that means the before, during, the day after each of these holidays, as well as the time between Christmas and new year's we saw 0.35 to 0.36. So not a huge rise, but it was a rise nonetheless. Now what about calculating this cost per link click? Because if what LinkedIn is saying is real that fewer people are running ads, so we should see costs drop, that should affect our cost per link click. And we do see this to a very small degree. The average cost per link click in the dataset was $8.70. And then we saw on the holiday, we were getting an average of $8.55. So about 15 cents less, maybe nothing to write home about, but it is a drop. The day after the holiday though, dropped down to $8.29. What was so interesting was the day before the holidays had a significantly higher cost per link click. We're averaging $10.88 over the $8.70 average. What about CPMs? We actually found that CPMs were slightly higher over the holidays than normal, but it really was just slightly. The average CPM that we were tracking was just about $30. And then we saw the holiday and the day after dropping to a little under $30. Again, the day before the holiday was more expensive though. They were averaging $36 CPM. All right. So all of those engagement metrics are one thing, but if we care about conversions, tell me about that. Well, conversion rates were lower across all the holidays that all led to higher costs per lead, especially during that break between Christmas and new year's. Now my cost per lead metric, this is costs divided by click conversions as well as leads. So it combines if you're driving conversions from the website or leads through LinkedIn lead gen forms. So our average cost per lead was about $139. The day before the holiday and on the holiday, we were averaging 199. So it really spiked higher costs per lead there. The day after the holiday dropped down to 156, which is still significantly over our normal of 139. All right. So here's my recommendation for next year. When you hear your reps saying what you should and shouldn't do, remember that engagement was down costs were up and conversions cost more across the whole board. So for single image ads specifically, I would scale way back on those or pause entirely. I just didn't see great performance from those. \nAll right. Next is conversation ads. When we look at the metric of open rate, that shows us how members are engaging with their messages. It shows us that they're in there when they hit open, we know they are engaging even if it is just to mark a message as red. We see low open rates on the holiday itself and then much higher open rates during the break between Christmas and new year's. This totally makes sense to me. It signals that people were logging in and they were receiving these messages on the holidays, but they weren't actually opening them until after and during the break. For example, our normal open rate here across the dataset was around 41%. On holidays, it was about 31%. So quite a bit lower. But then if we look at the period between Christmas and new year's, we see a 46.9% open rate. Definitely people catching up. I also looked at this cost per link click metric we see on the holiday itself. Cost per link click was significantly higher. It was almost $30 when normal is about 21. Then because we had so many opens between Christmas and new year's in the period that I'll call the break that cost per link click drop down to $17. So about $5 less than average universally across the board. Conversion rates were lower during the holidays. Normal average conversion rate here across the dataset is about 24%. It was averaging during the holidays of about 21%. It did spike a little bit during the break. It spiked up to 25%. Now, if I had to guess, I would say that during the break is when people are having a lot fewer emails come in. They're able to think a little bit more. They're not quite as busy. And that's when they're opening and converting on some of those conversation ads. So my recommendation next year, go ahead and pause sponsored messaging on the day of the holiday, but then turn right back on immediately after. Next are thought leader ads. Thought leader ads are so interesting because it tells us a lot about how members are interacting with their newsfeed during the holiday. We see engagement rates are higher than average before and during the holiday, but actually dropped the day after. But those are engagement rates. When we look at link click through rates, which is usually what I'm most interested in. If you have a thought leader ad that will drive to some sort of a link or a landing page, our link click through rate was about 0.18%. The day before the holiday, it was 0.4. So it was over double on the holiday itself, still higher than normal. And then the day after it drops down to 0.12%. The break in between was about 0.3%. So still almost double the average. I'm not quite sure over holidays why we'd see engagement rates drop, but link click through rates increase. Not totally sure, but I'd love to hear your ideas on that. Now, normal CPMs on thought leader ads were about $31. The day before holidays, they spiked up to $38. But then on the day of the holiday and the day after they dropped a little bit from average. Strangely enough, during the break, CPMs were about $5 higher than they were on average. So based off of those findings, my recommendation next year is go ahead and pause your thought leader ads on the holiday itself, but keep active before and after. All right, now how about video consumption on holidays? Are you running video ads? I love them. This one actually really surprised me. View rates for video ads were universally depressed compared to the average. The average is about 23% view rates, but then during the holidays, either before and after, they were hovered between about 16 to 19%. So definitely seems like fewer people are willing to actually start engaging with video content. I tracked a cost per 25% view metric, a cost per 50%, cost per 75% and cost per completion. And what we noticed is that cost per 25% view, 50% and 75% were all lower than the average. So this is kind of cool. For example, here cost per 25% video view hovered around 31% on average, but it jumped between about 0.12 and 0.29 during the holidays. Cost per completion was only higher on the holiday itself and the rest of the holidays, it was lower than the average. So having lower video view rates, but also lower costs signals to me a drop in competition, just like LinkedIn says, we're getting slightly better video costing here because other advertisers are pausing their ads. And even though there are fewer people to see the ads, it all lowers down and costs us less. Video completion rate was a really interesting metric here because they are higher across the board than average, meaning fewer people are starting to watch the videos, but the ones who do, they end up watching longer. This is really encouraging for video content. To put some numbers here, the average video completion rate was 3.4%. And then the day before the holiday, 5.3, the day of the holiday, 4.7 and the day after 5.2. Then that break in between, we're at 5.6. So crazy high video completion rates. That's really interesting. So my recommendation for next year, keep running video ads during the holidays. Doesn't seem like you can go wrong. For all of these metrics, I combined the holidays, but we have to ask ourselves which holiday actually wins here. So I pulled each holiday out individually to analyze it. Interestingly enough, Thanksgiving has the highest ad engagement rates and the lowest cost per engagement. I don't know what to credit that to, except maybe if we're advertising to the entire North American continent, the Canadian audience, though smaller, if they're not actually celebrating Thanksgiving, then maybe we'd see engagement rates that didn't fall as much. New Year's Day had the highest video view rate and the very best consumption metrics for video. So I think people were sitting back on New Year's Day as they were lounging around and watching video content. Works for me. Thanksgiving had the best link click through rate, but New Year's had the lowest cost per link click. Thanksgiving won the award for having the lowest cost per conversion. Now Christmas didn't have the best metrics for anything, but I'm going to give it an award for my favorite holiday simply because of how much I love Jesus. \nSo as for takeaways, would I advertise over the holidays with my own money? No, I probably wouldn't. I would keep video ads running and in fact I'd still go video thought leader ads. I think they're still going to perform really well, but pretty much the rest of the metrics across the board weren't impressive to me. I wouldn't go out of my way to advertise on those days. Now one major caveat here is that all of these accounts, because they are under our management, we are bidding really carefully for the majority of these were bidding manual CPC, which means if there were major spikes in CPMs and CPCs, we wouldn't see it. We would just see less volume. So it is totally possible that some of you saw costs super spike, especially when those engagement rates dropped and it's because you're bidding by maximum delivery, which I get it's LinkedIn's default. So you might just select it thinking that that's going to be the best thing, but if you did see your costs spike, remember, go check out episode 89 of the podcast where we talk about bidding strategies. A manual CPC bid is going to get you the lowest costs 90% of the time. I would love to hear how your ads performed over the holidays or even just a simple note saying we didn't take the bait. We paused all our ads. If so, good for you. \nNow, if you're not already a member of the LinkedIn ads fanatics community, what are you waiting for?

Unlike traditional benchmarks that focus solely on marketing performance, this report integrates both \nmarketing and sales metrics\n, offering a \nholistic view of what success looks like\n for startups.\nKey Takeaways:\nThe Evolution of Measurement in B2B Marketing\nThe top-performing startups are \nmeasuring marketing success beyond lead generation\n, focusing on sales metrics like \nmeetings booked, opportunities created, and revenue closed\n.\nSales and marketing are \nincreasingly aligned\n, with some companies merging them into a single \n\"Revenue Team\"\n to \neliminate attribution battles\n.\nThe Growing Impact of Executive Thought Leadership\nStartups that integrate \nexecutive and industry thought leadership\n into their content strategy see \nhigher engagement rates and stronger conversion rates\n through the funnel.\nData shows that \nretargeting audiences who saw thought leadership ads converted 45% more frequently\n than those who only saw traditional brand ads.\nLow-lift, high-impact content\n (such as quick takes from executives) performs \nbetter than highly produced videos\n.\nThe Shift to an ABM (Account-Based Marketing) Strategy\nEarly-stage startups have \nincreased ABM adoption by 30%\n in just two years.\nMore companies are \nleveraging LinkedIn’s ABM tools\n, dynamically integrating CRM data and \nintent signals\n from platforms like G2 to refine their targeting.\nSuccessful startups focus on \npipeline acceleration campaigns\n, ensuring they \nengage buying committees throughout the entire sales cycle\n.\nReimagining the B2B Funnel\nThe traditional \nmarketing funnel is outdated\n, and leading companies are \nshifting to an “in-market vs. out-of-market” approach\n (based on LinkedIn’s 95-5 rule).\nCompanies that engage \nearly in the buyer’s journey\n (before prospects enter the market) are \nmore likely to be on their final shortlist when they’re ready to buy\n.\nThe \"Measurement Gold Rush\"\nStartups are investing in \nadvanced measurement solutions\n (e.g., \nHockeyStack, Factors AI, Dreamdata\n) to track \nmulti-touch attribution and incrementality\n.\nThe mindset is shifting to \naccepting that not everything can be perfectly measured\n and prioritizing \nlonger time horizons\n for campaign evaluation.\nFinal Thoughts & Call to Action\nThe \nfull benchmark report\n is available in the show notes, and listeners are encouraged to \nread along\n.\nRuby invites listeners to \nconnect with her on LinkedIn\n for more insights and upcoming research.\nAJ encourages \nLinkedIn Ads fanatics\n to check out the \nLinkedIn Ads Fanatics community\n for exclusive content, courses, and coaching.\nThis episode provides \ngame-changing insights\n into LinkedIn advertising and B2B marketing strategy, especially for startups looking to \nscale efficiently\n while ensuring sales and marketing are aligned.\nWant more insights?

All right, without further ado, let's hop right into the interview with Ruby. Let's hit it.\nAJ\nRuby, so excited to have you here on the podcast. Thank you for joining us. \nRuby\nThanks for having me, AJ. I'm thrilled to be here. \nAJ\nFor those of you who have not heard of Ruby James, she leads the LinkedIn Marketing for Startups organization there within LinkedIn. Welcome, we're so excited to have you here. Tell us a little bit more about your background. \nRuby\nYeah, so you already shared this, but I most recently lead our LinkedIn Marketing for Startups org. I've been part of our Startups org since its inception four years ago. I've actually been at LinkedIn almost for nine and a half years now, which is so wild to think about.\nBut a little bit about the LinkedIn Marketing for Startups team, which again has been the largest portion of my LinkedIn journey. This team was created really with the goal of helping startups speed time to ROI on LinkedIn. And that was really done through our team's specialized startup specific support. And what that includes is LinkedIn Marketing Strategy and Advisory on other important levers that we found drive strong results on LinkedIn, including Advisory on Sales and Marketing Alignment, Measurement, the latest Go to Market Insights, Board Ready Reporting, all the things that again, ensure that your paid marketing strategy is optimized and efficient and really yields the highest ROI possible. We also focus on partnering with VCs to ensure they're aware of all the best practices that enable startups in their portfolio to maximize the value they see on LinkedIn. And so that's really a little bit about our team, where I spend the majority of my time and I should say all of my time in the work side of me, a little bit about me personally. So outside of work, I'm based in San Francisco. I always joke I'm a third generation San Franciscan, so a unicorn in my own right. And I love hiking. I also like to surf. I'm an avid yogi and actually teach yoga on the side at my local studio, as well as volunteering at a few organizations that bring yoga to underserved communities. So spending a lot of time both inside and outside of work on things I'm very passionate about, including startups and yoga movement, nature being outside as much as I can. \nAJ\nThat is so cool. It's great to get to know you better. I love so much that you have an entire organization within LinkedIn dedicated just to startups, because yes, startups, they require different attention. They need more help and they need different help for LinkedIn ads. So I'm so glad. It seems like a big hug from LinkedIn to startups that they gave you this team. \nRuby\nI love the description you use, big hug.\nYes, there's definitely other verticals throughout LinkedIn marketing, but we're actually the only verticalized team within our larger where we sit new business org. So essentially we verticalized to support startups in their first typically one to two plus years when they're first building their foundations on LinkedIn. Because we know that startups have such unique needs, they have aggressive growth goals, they need to see ROI fast and accelerate the testing phase, especially when trying a new channel. And so we were able to really make the case to give specifically startups, again, in this stage that they're in when they're first trying and sampling LinkedIn, this big hug. So it's great. \nAJ\nOh, totally. All right, so the reason why we brought you here on the show is because you and your team authored a new report that I think is incredible. It's called Growth Benchmarks for Scaling B2B Startups. Can you tell us about the inception of this report? \nRuby\nYes, so I'd love to share a little bit more about kind of the impetus of the report and how we got here. So yes, as you said, introducing the Growth Benchmarks for Scaling B2B Startups report. As I mentioned, my team supports thousands of startups and over the course of the last couple years, both gathering from direct conversations with marketing leaders and also just aggregating, surging topics and trends that we were hearing across our customer calls. What we found was really the biggest ask from our customers was to understand what good looks like in this new era of B2B. So we all know the B2B landscape has fundamentally changed over the last few years due to macro challenges. Everyone's talking about larger B2B buying committees, shifting B2B buyer priorities, increased competition. And really what we've heard, like the biggest ask was our startups wanting to know what to do or how to succeed in this new environment? And so I first started to look at like what already existed in the market today to solve this. And I observed that although there were a good amount of B2B Benchmark reports that already exist, whether it's from partners like Gartner or VC firms, what I was finding was that most of the, or I would say all of the pre-existing B2B Benchmark reports really only featured the medium and top quartile of growth benchmarks and nothing else.\nAnd I found that it was super important to democratize these insights, but really go beyond just that and democratize the how. Like, okay, great, we now know what the top quartile is seeing from a growth rate perspective or funnel conversion rate perspective, but like how did they get there? And so understanding that there was a gap in being able to really share and highlight and democratize the how and the tactics, obviously on the LinkedIn side, we're sitting on some really rich B2B insights. We decided to pull in HubSpot for startups, given their strong reach in the startup community and their role as a CRM and being able to touch what happens beyond the lead through to closed one. So we brought HubSpot for startups in to really partner together and solve the question or answer the question, like what are the top performing startups doing? The ones with the highest year over year growth, the strongest funnel conversion rates, what are they doing strategy and tactic wise? And so together with HubSpot for startups, we surveyed 250 B2B startups and then also analyze top performing startups on LinkedIn with the strongest results and pulled through these insights to really bring together and bring to life this report that highlights the median top quartile metrics like other reports you'll see in the market, but also the how, like what startups are doing to actually get their strategy and tactic wise. \nAJ\nOh, perfect. And first of all, everyone I talked to loves benchmark reports. It's super important that when we are doing something that we can tell like, yes, are we going way off into left field or are we doing a good job or are we even like killing it, slaying it, which you can find out, especially cause your report has both the median, which you can be like, okay, are we totally off base here? And you have the top quartile to be like, are we destroying? This is great. \nRuby\nTotally. Again, yeah, the top quartile and median benchmarks, both business metrics and sales and marketing metrics serve as a really nice gauge and pulse point to understand like how am I stacking up against my peers that share the same perhaps ARR bucket as me if we're looking at business metrics or like ASP if we're looking at sales and marketing metrics. And then yeah, taking it a step further, like really what I get most excited about with this report and some of the key takeaways we'll talk about today are again, what came out of us being able to cut the data and actually see what are the startups that have the highest year-over-year growth across all the ARR buckets, the strongest conversion rates through the funnel and cost per through the funnel across all the ASP buckets. What specifically is that cohort of top performing startups doing strategy wise? And even if you're exceeding the metrics that you're seeing from a benchmark standpoint, you can still then pull through these strategy insights to perhaps go far and beyond the benchmarks that you're seeing in the report as well. Or again, if you're not where you wanna be, these tactics are gonna help you get there because this is what the top performing startups are seeing work for them. So three kind of key takeaways that I'm excited to dig in more with you that came through our research. First is this fundamental shift in measurement that we're seeing, as I mentioned, everyone's talking about longer sales cycles, bigger buying committees, it takes more time and effort to win a deal. And really what came through in our research is that the top performing startups are measuring the impact of their marketing programs over a longer time horizon. And they know in order to understand the value of their efforts and really what's working best and driving the strongest ROI, they really need to extend the horizon in which they measure. That was one key insight that I'm really excited to dig more in with you on. And then the two others, number two, so what we'll see in the data, and I'm super also, I'm excited about all the insight that you can hear, but for number two, we can now finally point to the ROI of a strong executive engagement strategy. And I think historically what I've seen across our customers is that executive thought leadership has kind of been seen as this like vanity portion of their strategy. And we now actually have data to show that it's driving the strongest results through the lens of direct marketing source pipeline.\nAnd with that, we now have again, like these ROI insights that reinforce it to be a core part of your marketing strategy. And there's now an opportunity cost to not incorporating your execs into your marketing strategy. And as a startup, you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't. So that's one big one I'm really excited to dig more in with you on. I know, you know, having followed you for a while, you have a perspective on that too.\nTotally. And then the third insight or takeaway that I'm excited to dive a little bit more into today as well is how we're seeing these top performing startups reimagine their funnel. So what really came out of the research and further conversation with a lot of the thought leaders that we interviewed for this report is how we need to reimagine our funnel. I feel like we talk a lot about the funnel. The word funnel shows up all throughout this report. It's a really helpful mental model for marketers and leaders to think about, but we're all well aware that it doesn't actually work like that. And this report really started to make it clear that we need to reimagine how we talk about marketing through the stages of the B2B buyer's journey. And then, you know, beyond those three takeaways, I think this underlying buzz and theme is around, you know, tightening sales and marketing alignment, something we've been talking about for five plus, seven plus years. But we'll talk more about kind of how that pulls through and how that's an important piece to always be evaluating. But those were really the core takeaways that came out beyond, you know, why we did this. It became very clear that, again, beyond the actual metrics and benchmarks, there were some key insights that we know are gonna help startups be more successful as they go to market in this new B2B era.\nAJ\nAmazing. And just for all you fanatics who are listening, I'm sure you wanna check out the report. We put the link right down there in the show notes. So go open it up and read right alongside of us as we're talking about it. All right, so Ruby, obviously going through a report like this, there's going to be lots of information and maybe some outcomes where you go, yeah, duh. Like that just, it told us exactly what we already knew. Were there any of those kind of reaffirming beliefs or things that the data told you, like, yep, I already knew that and now I just know it a little bit stronger? \nRuby\nYeah, it's a great question. And for those of you that have opened up the report and are following along, in the very beginning of the report, you'll see some cuts of benchmark data. So both business metrics, again, cut by ARR bucket and then conversion rates for the funnel and lead volume and cost per so the funnel by ASP or average sales price. Again, when we pulled through this cohort of startups that had the strongest metrics, so we consider them like these top performers, we kind of found something, again, that we kind of were like, duh, like this is what we're hearing on calls, this is what we're seeing across the thousands of startups in general, but it was even more concentrated within this cohort of top performing startups, was really this shift in measuring success beyond the lead. So now about 75% or 3 fourths of the top performing startups that we surveyed shared that their North Star metric was now downstream KPIs, like sales meeting volume, opportunities, total pipeline, closed one revenue. I could even say three years ago, there were much more startups that were measuring success on lead volume and demo volume. Like, hey, we just need to bring as many demos as possible. And I think it's great that we're seeing this shift to measuring metrics that actually matter down to the bottom line and holding both marketing and sales accountable together to those higher ROI focus metrics and really taking ownership over the entire journey through to closed one. We interviewed Kacie Jenkins, who's the SVP of Sendoso, and she really validated how great this is and how she is bringing this shift within her startup, Sendoso as well. And she actually even referenced the CMO panel at Sester that recently happened a few months ago where it was a core topic where more and more marketing teams are taking ownership over the full pipeline number and they're taking it a step further by doing away with those sales versus marketing attribution battles. And I really loved how Kacie, her and I chatted after this report to again, get her perspective and any other insights we can glean. And she made the call out that she now refers to her sales team and marketing team at Sendoso as one team called the revenue team. Cool. She's completely shifted where it's less about who gets credit for what. And instead these teams are really up leveling their measurement sophistication. And again, up leveling or adjusting and enhancing the timeline and time horizons to measure what shared motions or tactics both teams are seeing the most success with, what's moving the needle, what's driving the strongest pipeline, conversions to the funnel and ROI. And so that's been like a key shift that we're seeing. And although it's like, duh, like if startups are now gonna be very ROI focused, like marketers should be measuring success beyond the lead. It was really helpful to see the data and seeing how it's now like very much table stakes. Majority of startups are reporting on this change within that top performing cohort. But I'm curious your perspective on this AJ, like I'm curious if you're seeing more marketing and sales sharing, same numbers, if there's any challenges that are coming up as a result to that. But again, I was very excited to see this validated. \nAJ\nYeah, totally we've seen the same thing. Over the last 10 years of us being an agency in business dealing almost exclusively with B2B, we definitely have seen like probably the first seven years of our inception, the majority of clients were very much lead focused. Like get us conversions, get us leads. We're gonna throw them over the wall to sales and then get mad at them when they're not working the deals hard enough. Over the last three years, I've definitely seen a movement. And if I had to guess why, I think there's probably two factors. The first is that we have better technologies at our fingertips to allow us this kind of tracking. If you didn't have even your CRM tracking what your LinkedIn ads performance or any ads performance was doing, you really stuck. Like, yeah, you could go and marry those things up manually, but that takes a lot of time and effort and you may not be able to do it super often. Whereas now all of these tools, I mean, we've got factors, dream data, I can go on and on. So many of these attribution platforms that do have direct integrations right into LinkedIn's ecosystem and they also plug into other ecosystems allowing us to kind of see everything in one picture. So that's kind of like number one, we have tools. And then second of all, I think marketers we're getting better. We're getting better at using those tools and understanding. And I think B2B marketers, like we're finally stepping into this role of like, we have to be smarter and we have to be more capable and better with data than B2C marketers are in a lot of cases because we're dealing with longer sales cycles, more of an incomplete picture, larger deals, all of these things just scream to me like you need to get better at data.\nRuby\n Totally, this wasn't included in depth in the report, but coming again, as I've had more conversations about the data, about these insights and what we're learning from the research we did, I did a quick look, we use Gong and I was able to see the increase in mentions of these like third party sophisticated measurement solutions. As you mentioned, like factors, AI, hockey stack, RevShur dream data. And we've seen about 300% increase in mentions, just showing exactly what you said, where we're just seeing this shift towards bringing on these more sophisticated measurement solutions to be able to really track and understand what's moving the needle as you work, more closely with sales or align the same goals as sales. And then the other piece that just more anecdotally that I've been seeing, again, sitting on all the data that we have on the B2B side at LinkedIn is we are noticing more and more startups recently hiring for like a head of measurement or head of analytics. Oftentimes that role might sit with someone that also just owns demand gen or again, it's not bucketed as its own specific scope, but I'm seeing that it is now becoming more and more common to prioritize bringing that on sooner. \nAJ\nOh, I totally believe that. Yeah, the sooner we can get those insights and anyone out there, if you're considering a job or a role switch, look into data science and your brain being plugged into marketing's data and sales data could do some incredible things. I think there's gonna be a role open, at least one in every large company. \nRuby\nThe other really interesting reaffirming insight we saw, and this is kind of a nice segue into the first part around just, again, sales and marketing, sharing more of those downstream metrics and marketing taking more ownership over the full pipeline number versus just looking at lead volume is what we're seeing startups do with ABM. And what we found that super interesting is the top performing startups have really doubled down on aligning their targeting with sales, which again, if we're gonna share a total pipeline number, like it makes sense that we'll then optimize or think about our targeting more strategically with them as well. We all know ABM is table stakes. So like this again was another like, okay, this is what we're seeing. This just like validates what we all already know. But what I thought was like, you know, more interesting or like a step further in what we already know was that we actually looked at on the LinkedIn platform percentage of startups by stage that are leveraging an ABM list. And the most interesting data point that we saw was we looked at this in 2022, and then we looked at it again this year in 2024. And we saw that early stage startups use of ABM actually grew by 30%.\nSo even though we all know ABM is, you know, what you should have this as a portion of your strategy, we all know, you know, it's super important to align with sales and target their, the accounts that they're prioritizing. We saw that actual shift in behavior where more and more startups earlier on are actually bringing it into their strategy. And there's a few different ways that we kind of saw that come to life. I wanna quote, there's this amazing marketing leader, her name's Betty Mok. She used to lead marketing at LinkedIn and then she moved on to Pendo I.O. and now is at Consensus. And she, when her and I were chatting through this report, she talked about this trend of like marketing deepening their focus on what she calls riding shotgun with sales. And so, you know, she described that as more and more, again, of these top performing startups are targeting all of their decision makers. They're not just targeting the, you know, job titles that might be requesting the demo or, you know, just the C-suite. If they think that that's gonna be their needle mover or influencer, they're targeting decision makers, influencers, even hidden buyers across their target accounts. And they're doing one to many, one to few, one to one, ABM tactics. And then one of the newer things we're seeing is the addition of pipeline acceleration campaigns. So more and more marketing teams are targeting open pipelines to nurture these buying committees from initial conversion all the way to closed one. And we're seeing different tactics to do so, whether that's, you know, highly targeted nurturer streams, addressing persona specific challenges or addressing, you know, an industry or segment challenge. We really now have the data from this report. And again, from like a lot of the conversations that we had with these thought leaders that buy, as Betty says, like riding shotgun with sales from, you know, initial engagement with your brand all the way to close one. Those startups are seeing shorter sales cycles and higher win rates. So again, there's this opportunity cost in this new era of B2B go to market that again, if we're not staying present throughout the entire journey and marketing kind of helping sales do so and creating that halo effect, you know, you're not gonna see as strong of funnel conversion rates and close one conversion rates. And they're not gonna, your deals aren't gonna close as quickly. But, you know, again, you've been doing this for forever. I think you can agree that ABM has been a conversation for, you know, I want to say hundreds of years.\nAJ\nYeah.\nRuby\nBut we'd love to hear your take on this. And again, like how you've seen ABM evolve most recently. \nAJ\nWell, it's so interesting because with LinkedIn ads, we've been able to do all of these things. I think it was like 2017. \nRuby\nYeah. \nAJ\nWhen we got the ability to upload lists. Like we've been able to do all of this stuff. But if you had to think about every time you have access to a new audience, let me download it to a CSV. Let me go upload it to LinkedIn. Let me go create a campaign targeting this list. Like, let's be honest, we as marketers were busy and we're not always thinking about doing that. But this is a technology nod, I think. Like now because we have CRMs that are directly integrated into LinkedIn, we have products like Zapier who can create a dynamic list and keep it updated for us, push it right into LinkedIn. It takes out all of those middle steps and now marketers are actually using it because surprise, surprise, if we have to do it manually, it's probably gonna drop. \nRuby\nYou're totally right. It's through the test of time, we've been able to upload accounts within LinkedIn. And that's really what differentiates us as our first party data and our ability to really accurately target, obviously the right professionals at the right specific companies that you want to engage and get in front of. I think to your point, what's been so great over the last couple of years is how we've evolved in our ability to leverage, obviously like a Zapier or even like our intent partners like G2 to kind of combine your data with intent data to get even more specific around, okay, like if I have X amount of dollars, I should be allocating that to the portion of my target account list. If I can't reach 100% of it, who's most likely to convert or most likely to talk to sales or ready to talk to sales? LinkedIn on our side, we've also developed a new tab where you can actually see it's referred to as like the company's engagement report, the new like ABM companies hub where you can actually see companies with the strongest engagement with your brand to help you think about slicing and dicing your list in different ways. Maybe you want to create target account list with the sales as target accounts that have shown low engagement with your brand and you want to serve them a different message than the accounts that have already gone to your website or have engaged with you organically. So what's cool is that again, to your point, AJ, we're evolving more and more how we can get even smarter with ABM, both with LinkedIn's data and then the data of our partners, which is pretty awesome. \nAJ\nOh, I'm a huge fan. Thank you.\nRuby\nWell, collective thank you to LinkedIn product if they're listening. They've been very avid too and like listening to Gong calls and understanding what more we can be doing to up level what it is we bring to our startups and the broader market, which is awesome. \nAJ\nOh yeah. \nRuby\nThere's one other piece I think of this that might be worth sharing in like the what was reaffirming to you. And I know I mentioned it as a takeaway, like kind of like a always on hum in the beginning, but I think something else that needs to be mentioned is just like what sales and marketing alignment means today. I think what's interesting is, since the inception of our startups team, four to five years ago, we've been talking about sales and marketing alignment and what we found in our research that again, just validated what we already knew, but it's still important to say because it's so important is the startups with the highest year over year growth, the strongest funnel conversion rates and strongest efficiencies like cost per so the funnel, they actually cited not just strong sales and marketing alignment, but actually the behavior of continuing to find new ways to improve sales and marketing alignment as one of their most effective go to market strategy enhancements that helped improve their funnel conversion rates. So I bring that up because obviously aligning your targeting with sales, thinking about sharing, how you're gonna reassess your North Star metrics with sales and measure that, but also more generally, like how can you as a startup keep up leveling your sales and marketing alignment is just so, so, so important. And I think that kind of relates to everything we just talked about and kind of where, you know, what else we'll probably talk about, but I guess the reason I bring it up is because even if you think you have amazing sales and marketing alignment, there is still always something more you can be doing. And as you learn more about, you know, what's happening with the deals in your pipeline, you know, what you're seeing work, what you're seeing, you know, you need to optimize or maybe learnings, like those are kind of the data points that you can use to improve how you align with your sales team and consistently look into that on whether it's a monthly or quarterly basis, like reassessing how you can be more effective with sales. \nAJ\nYeah, I've always said no amount of speaking with, developing a relationship with your sales counterparts is wasted. It's kind of this analogy of sharpening the saw. So if you're trying to cut down a tree, you could take your saw out there and, you know, have hard labor, you know, crank on that tree for two hours, or you could spend 10 minutes at the beginning to sharpen your saw and then only spend 20 minutes. You've taken time away from doing what you were expecting to do to spend a little bit of time to sharpen a saw. It feels like you're going out of your way. It feels like you're wasting time, but then overall, like you've actually ended up saving over an hour. That's kind of what I think about that sales and marketing alignment conversation. \nRuby\nI love that, yes. And I think you're, that's actually one of my favorite quotes. I think it's an Abraham Lincoln quote. As you were talking, I looked it up. It's Abraham Lincoln was often quoted, \"Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.\" No, it's exactly so spot on where it's like every month as a sales and marketing org, as a revenue team, you should be carving out time to sharpen your axe. And even like last week, a VC partner reached out to me and asked for the latest insights on speed to lead, because even though, you know, one of their portcoes has a speed to lead process and SLA, they wanted to identify if there's been new data to support something different, or like they looked at their top converting deals and when the reps reached out to those marketing source leads and they were able to then further optimize that. So love that metaphor or quote of sharpening the sales ax, the sales and marketing ax on a regular basis. \nAJ\nTotally, I need to actually attribute it to Abraham Lincoln rather than. \nRuby\nNo, it's your quote now, it's fine.\nAJ\nAll right, so those were all really good to be like, okay, this is reaffirming what we already knew, but maybe were there any insights that you got out of this research and report where you were like, whoa, I wasn't expecting that at all. \nRuby\nYes, I'm so glad you asked. And, you know, I get excited about the things that were reaffirmed, but obviously I'm most excited about like what came out that was like shocking or new or, you know, at this moment of innovation where like we're all learning together how to be effective. The most shocking insight is related to executive thought leadership and how that really moves the needle at the top of the funnel or when you're creating demand within your ICP. I first though, wanna kind of take a step back and mention one reaffirming table stakes thing that is gonna build on, you know, that allows us to jump off onto the shocking insight. But what I wanna first start by saying is like, it has become table stakes. Like we know that every single top performing startup that we surveyed and we looked at their performance and their strategy, it is table stakes to deploy a full funnel strategy on LinkedIn or I shouldn't say on LinkedIn in general. And we know that full funnel strategy is really accelerate the buyer's journey. We now have data support that startups active with a full funnel strategy, see a 6X increase in conversion rates to the funnel. They actually see a 2X increase in needs or prospects readiness to talk to sales. So we did some analysis to like validate that again. There's much stronger ROI and full funnel. Even though I feel like everyone knows this and I'm curious your thoughts, AJ, on this. Like, you know, four years ago, if we had recommended, if my team had recommended to some, you know, most of our startup customers to run top of funnel, like many or ungate things, like they would have laughed in our faces. And like, you know, the portion of investment that went to bottom funnel, product focused messaging or request demo pricing, like all the things that are more demand capture, we're seeing there's like a really big shift and a shift more towards ungated up funnel kind of top of funnel content and messaging. And so we're seeing a lot of that in our marketing and strategies. And what we found in the data, and this is really the shocking kind of exciting, innovative insight is around executive thought leadership and the role that it plays in your demand creation efforts. And even in your demand capture efforts, like throughout, you know, the funnel and your entire marketing strategy and demand gen strategy. You know, again, looking at everyone's running full funnel,you know, you can say you're running full funnel, but you're mainly focused on your product or you're doing XYZ, which isn't fully full funnel. But I say that because like what matters is, you know, how can I cut through the noise and what's actually working? And what we found is that again, this cohort of startups, you know, these top performers with the strongest metrics, both business and marketing and sales metrics, they actually cited content featuring company execs or industry thought leaders and third party reports as the most impactful content type that actually moved their buyers through their journey faster. So actually accelerated them through to close on revenue. So we now have data to support that you are really doing your startup a disservice. You're missing out on revenue. If you are not putting your executives front and center in your marketing strategy and, you know, LinkedIn and what you'll see in the report, LinkedIn published research that shows now, you know, people trust people, people trust humans over brands. This came from some research we did in collaboration with Edelman. You know, it makes sense, you know, if you go back to first principles, like it just makes sense, like people trust people. And so it is now something that, you know, we as marketers, especially startups, when they're sitting on such gold, like they have a founder who obviously has a reason that they founded their startup. They have a unique perspective. They're innovating in a space that, you know, might be saturated with some of these incuments. And we need to think about how we can bring those perspectives to the forefront. And that's really what we're seeing move the needle and actually drive higher conversion rates through the funnel. \nAJ\nAnd I totally agree with that, especially the very first time I got to use a thought leader ad when they came out back in like 2023, I ran exactly the same message from the company page as from one of the executives in the company. And the difference was shocking. It was like half a percent engagement rate from the company, the exact same message from an individual. We have like a 11% engagement rate. And I immediately became a believer like, oh, same message, same audience, but they gravitate to people. If you have a face telling you something, you're gonna pay more attention than if it's a company, a brand you've never heard of before. So absolutely believer in this, especially after all of our testing we've done with thought leader ads, it's game changer. \nRuby\nTotally. And just at the macro level bird's eye view across our thousands of startups, both anecdotally and we have now legitimate data now that we've had thought leadership ads available for about a year now, as you mentioned, like we're seeing growing adoption of that leadership ads, but then as you mentioned, it is so far outperforming all of our other traditional brand ad formats. We're seeing higher engagement. It's about like a 1.6 X increase on average compared to brand ads that don't come from an executive. So just as you mentioned, that's again, the average over a larger sample size. And then most importantly, on the impact on their bottom line, like we did an analysis. So we actually looked at a retargeting audience that was built surely off of thought leadership ads. So every single prospect in that retargeting audience saw thought leadership ads. And then we also had a retargeting audience that only saw other brand ads, not using thought leadership ads. So there was no executives included in any of their ads. And we saw a 45% lift in demo conversion rates from retargeting audiences that saw a thought leadership ad compared to the traditional brand ads that didn't feature execs. Wow. And we also have data that, again, many of our startup customers will ask for where they'll say, \"Hey, can we see the incremental lift between thought leadership ads versus something else we're doing on the brand side so we can really prove to our executives that this is something they should be spending their time on and investing in?\" And I think that leads me to, and I'm curious, AJ, what you've seen with your clients, but I would say the biggest challenge we see and hear across our startup customers is that it's really hard to get executive buy-in and get them to participate. And I think, number one, I wanna bust this big myth. It seems like one of the bigger kind of concerns is that so many execs incorrectly think that they need to commit to this robust, big, exec engagement thought leadership strategy that's gonna be this huge investment in time. And in reality, it should be very low friction. And there's so many low friction, high impact ways to meaningfully accelerate your startup's growth and funnel conversion rates by getting out there and being part of your marketing team's content strategy. Some of the things that we're seeing is the best thought leadership ads are unplanned, unmanicured, very authentic, and it's literally just an executive sharing a hot take or a perspective from maybe a customer advisory board that day, or maybe someone posted something about a challenge that their ICP is having, and they just took that and re-shared it with a couple sentences. So again, I really wanna bust this misperception that you need to have this really robust strategy. And in reality, if you can just produce one to two, again, low friction, low lift, high impact perspectives, it goes a really long way in driving results for your marketing team and helping bring in more close to end revenue. \nAJ\nTotally. We've found some situations where a brand would share like a video that they paid 20 grand and they had a studio put all these complex animations together with. And we actually got better engagement, more conversions from a 30 second clip of an executive just talking right into their phone. And it was edited with an AI tool like Descript, that's 12 bucks a month. We got better engagement, better results from that. And what that taught me is like, people wanna hear from you and it doesn't need to be a huge ask or a huge lift from your executive team to just give you a quick snippet, a little bit of thought leadership. \nRuby\nTotally. I love that. That's such a great kind of data point to again reinforce how low friction, low lift this is. Something that I know my team and I will be prioritizing heading into this new year. So early, you know, calendar year 2025 is more easy best practices and tips and tricks for executives and founders in the startup space to align and incorporate executive thought leadership into their startups marketing strategies because it has such a strong impact. And there's so many things you could be doing with again, very little time, very little resources. And there's no one more well positioned to be effective here than startups. Because again, they are kind of coming into this space as innovators, they're newer, they're always innovating. They have new perspectives that they should be sharing. So super excited to lean more into helping more and more startups adopt this portion of their strategy because we now have the data to support that it really does move the needle from an ROI standpoint.\nAJ\nTotally, love that. All right, going through the report, there's a lot of gold here. I specifically from the advertiser perspective, I saw a lot of suggestions that are going to help us with improving the overall performance of our ads, improving conversion rates, improving ROI. I'm curious, what sort of trends and new ways of thinking does the report give us that we as advertisers can go and implement?\nRuby\nYeah, love this question. And you warned me that you wanted to make sure this conversation went deeper than what we had in the report and above and beyond, a lot of the insights and obviously we have the data and then we have the insights and the takeaways we can pull through. And then we have the hot takes from a lot of the thought leaders that we brought in to give us their perspective and validate what we were seeing in our research. And something that came up a lot was again, this idea of re-imagining the funnel. We use the word marketing funnel throughout the report, both in how we share our benchmarks. It's a well-known framework and mental model for marketers. So I do feel a little bit silly saying this because again, the word funnel is all over this report. But I do think in reality,we know that that's not how B2B buyers buy. And LinkedIn, our B2B Institute introduced the 95 five rule years ago. And it's really become more apparent that the top startups are re-imagining the funnel and instead thinking about their prospects through the lens of in-market versus out-of-market. And so I think more and more, we'll see kind of the word funnel disappear. And that's something that really became clear in our research, but AJ, I've been following you for a while and I know you have some thoughts on this. So I'm curious your reaction.\nAJ\nYeah, I've heard several advertisers come to me, I'm active in a Reddit community on LinkedIn ads and in our own private community. And I've had several people say, how do I go in and how do I reach that 5%? Cause they're the ones I wanna go and drive business from. And I just tell them like, forget it. Don't waste your money trying to hit the 5% because you're going to waste your money across the whole 95%. Think about your audience in terms of stages of interaction and getting to know you. And this really does feel a lot like the funnel, but we give them opportunities in stage one. This is what we would consider our initial touch with an audience. We have no idea at that point if they've ever heard of us before, have had any sort of interaction. And then we re-target those interactions at stage two where that's a little warmer. And then again, at a stage three. And what we find is even if you have the same calls to action all the way through all of those three stages, what you start to see is in stage three, conversion rates are five times higher than they are in stage two. And it teaches me that yes, there are 5% of your audience who are currently in market. Awesome. Do whatever you can to get in front of them for sure, but don't make your entire marketing program be about that. Instead, build an entire, I call it my lead generating machine. Build a whole ecosystem around your audience so that you can take those that are cold audiences and eventually warm them, educate them, nurture them until they are ready to respond at a high rate when you finally say, okay, you look ready, let's have you talk to sales.\nRuby\nTotally. It's so spot on and super helpful to hear like specifically how you think about it. And like the real data points that validate that's the right approach and the way we should all be thinking about it. My brain goes to this, the Google Zero Moment of Truth study. And there's also a Forrester report that I recently read. So this is not, again, a groundbreaking stat, everyone knows it, but it's around like, I think three fourths of B2B buyers choose a vendor that's first to help them with useful content. So we know that it is so important to be there first, before your buyer is in market, because if you're not, again, if we know that 74% of these B2B buyers are actually selecting the vendor that is helping them in the beginning with before they're in market, before they're ready, helping them educate them on potentially a problem that they may not be aware of. And again, being present when it matters most, like what really matters, and Kacie from Sandoso said this too, like her focus is how they can get on as many of their prospects day one vendor list as possible. Because again, to your point, if you're also just gonna be focused on that 5% of buyers that are in market, they already have top of mind, likely who they wanna go with. And so you're already too late and you're reducing that 5% by 75%, because 75% of them already know based on who they engage with in the beginning. \nAJ\nExactly. \nRuby\n Yeah, love that, we saw it in the data, we saw it in our conversations with all the thought leaders and it's super helpful to hear how you advise your customers, because that's totally how we should, or clients, because that's really how we should be thinking about it. \nAJ\nOh yeah, if you just show up right there at that last stage, more than likely they're just gonna say, \"Ah, we've already done our research, \"we don't have room for one more applicant to consider,\" and they just blow right past you. \nRuby\nMaybe they'll take the call with sales because they wanna make sure that they've done their due diligence across all the vendors, but you're still wasting, in a way, your sales team's time by not being present in the beginning, because again, they're less likely to go with you, and they likely also took that demo. Maybe there's something there in us doing some sort of calculation of lost time spent, or sales time spent on leads that didn't have that specific vendor on their consideration list, but they're still taking that call to check the box and make sure that they feel good about day one vendor they decide to go with. \nAJ\nThat would be super cool research, I would love to see that.\nRuby\nOkay, I would say there's one other innovative kind of trend or new way of thinking, and it kind of goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning of this conversation that you brought up just around measurement sophistication and where we're seeing our startups go. So I kind of noticed in what became really clear in our research, as well as the conversations we've had with the thought leaders that we featured in our research is really just around measurement. So both top performing startups mindset around measurement and then also how they're approaching measurement. So on the mindset piece, it became really clear from again, our research and our conversations that the top performing startups understand and get their executives and board on the same page that it's not possible to measure everything. And single touch attribution is completely misleading.\nAlthough it's more comfortable to think that we can measure everything, I think getting to a place where everyone can agree that it's inherently impossible and it also just doesn't make sense based on the way B2B buyers buy and they're buying behavior. Even if you looked at like there's so many great insights that came out of hockey stack and factors AI come to mind specifically around someone that converts obviously maybe they're doing some research or maybe they're not doing research yet. They're obviously like scrolling LinkedIn, looking for information to make them more productive and successful. They might see some helpful pieces of content that gets them to a place where they're ready to actually do some research. Maybe they go to Google, search for different things. And then you ask them, they eventually convert on a form. You ask them, how did you hear about us? And your attribution tool is telling you they came from Google, but they're telling you that they heard about you from someone somewhere very different. Kacie, also I'm quoting her a lot because she's amazing. She should come onto this podcast as well. Yes.\nShe can be part two, but she talks about how she was able to get her leadership and boards buy in on like rethinking measurement as a whole. Because if you actually just looked at your top performing channel, it would be website traffic. And she's like, that tells me nothing.\nAnd so again, it's step one in us all, or I should say like the top performing startups, just like rethinking and understanding and getting comfortable with the uncomfortable in adopting this mindset that it's not possible to measure everything. And we have to move away from just single touch attribution. And then that second piece is again, moving away from single touch attribution is like what I would call the umbrella of like approach. Okay, now that we know that the B2B buyer journey has gotten longer, it's more complex, we can't track everything. How can we at least up level the approach to measurement to at least feel really good about where we're seeing different tactics move the needle? Obviously, these different tactics work together. How can we understand incrementality? All the different pieces across multi-touch, across incrementality, across channel influence, measuring over longer time horizons, to at least get a sense of what's moving the needle and driving the strongest pipeline through the funnel and ultimately driving ROI. I was joking with somebody the other day, I know everyone's saying it's like the AI gold rush and I'm like, forget the AI gold rush, it is the measurement gold rush. And I feel like right now is this like key moment where we're watching startups, again, like up level and think through how they evolve their approach to measurement.\nCurious what you're seeing here too. I know that was a lot. So curious what you're seeing here too and your familiarity with kind of these different changes in mindset and approach. \nAJ\nYeah, I think five years ago, clients would come to us and they would go, LinkedIn is not profitable in and of itself. Let's say it's 80% profitable. And they'd say, let's go to a channel that is profitable. And now I look at it and go, wow, if any channel with direct attribution, if you can tell that you're within 20% and that might even be low, there are synergies with all your other channels that you can't measure, you won't know the impact until someone tells you down the road, like in the middle of closing a deal, someone goes, oh, by the way, I heard you on, I saw your ad on LinkedIn and you're like, oh, had no ID, you were sourced from LinkedIn. Your UTM showed us as you coming direct or from Google or something. So I love that. I think we need to realize that our measuring, our tracking, no matter how hard we try, it's always gonna be imperfect. And if it's, I always just assume it's probably 20% at least better than what it looks like. \nRuby\nTotally. \nAJ\nRuby, thank you so much for coming on and sharing the report with us. I hope everyone is opening it up right now and you're gonna go scour it. This is fantastic.
