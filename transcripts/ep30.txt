Summary:
LinkedIn made significant strides in their 2020 Ads roadmap despite the disruption from COVID-19. Major updates included expanded 
interest targeting
, 
company growth and category filters
, 
lead gen form and video view retargeting
, and 
contact targeting via device ID
. Notably, 
conversation ads
 gained traction with the addition of flowchart visual reporting and pre-built templates to simplify creation. Sponsored content also started supporting 
vertical video
, and advertisers could now 
delete individual creatives
. On the engagement front, LinkedIn Events and Live received improvements, such as the ability to retarget attendees and plan broadcasts with better registration workflows.
Looking ahead, LinkedIn teased exciting features for late 2020 and early 2021: 
story ads
, 
AB testing for creatives
, and 
CRM integrations
 for tracking deeper funnel metrics like MQLs and SQLs. Other launches included 
audience insights dashboards
 for ABM efforts, 
document ads
 for gated content delivery, and 
products on pages
, allowing companies to showcase offerings and gather user reviews. For ease of use, a 
Campaign Manager Lite
 was introduced for boosting posts directly, and LinkedIn Business Manager (similar to Facebook’s) was slated for late 2021 to simplify agency-client access control. Together, these updates aimed to make LinkedIn Ads more data-rich, targeted, and conversion-focused than ever.
