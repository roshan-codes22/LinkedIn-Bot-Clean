Summary:
When it comes to LinkedIn Ads, 
audience size matters more than you think
—but not in the way most people assume. Contrary to LinkedIn’s broad recommendation of 300,000+ members, running 
tightly segmented audiences between 20,000 and 80,000
 yields significantly better insights and efficiency. This allows you to track how specific segments perform—like seniority levels or company sizes—without diluting results in a giant, generalized campaign. Instead of one vague group, break it down: 
CMOs in one campaign, marketing managers in another
, all with the same ads. You’ll get actionable data on who clicks, who converts, and what content resonates—something you lose with bloated targeting.
That said, avoid segmenting just for the sake of it. Only divide audiences by 
criteria that actually help you learn something
 (like seniority, geography, or job function). And if a micro-audience is too small to spend much, group its data with similar segments to reveal trends across the board. This 
rolling analysis
 gives you control at scale—so you can increase budgets, improve offers, or cut underperformers with precision. Large audience sizes may seem easier, but they hide inefficiencies. If you’re serious about optimizing your LinkedIn Ads, 
micro-segmentation is the edge your competitors aren’t using.
