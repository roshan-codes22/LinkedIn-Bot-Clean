Episode 4 


Well hello there. Welcome to the LinkedIn ads expert course. If you're watching this course, you are hardcore about LinkedIn ads and I salute you for it. This course does assume that you've already watched the previous courses, the basics and the advanced LinkedIn ads courses. So if you haven't already watched those, make sure you pause this now and go back and watch those. They all build off of fundamental principles to each other. I'll admit to you that this course will feel a lot more disjointed than the others. With the other courses, a lot of times there's a story arc you can follow, but for the expert one, this is a lot of tips and tricks and little hacks here and there that are kind of all over the board. Some may be about running campaigns. Some may be about evaluating them. Some might be building them. And so I I apologize for the disjointed nature of this. But I know you'll find the value here. We're gonna start out this course by talking about the different types of data that Lincoln stores about its users. And then how we can use that data to target effectively. Next, we'll jump into some of the targeting hacks that you can use to really be superhuman in your ability to target. Then we'll dive into the intricacies of LinkedIn's back end system, things that you'll need to be aware of and then workarounds that you can work around to get better performance there. Next, we'll talk about some of the gotchas that you might be falling prey to with LinkedIn ads and help you learn more about them so that you're protected from those gotchas. Then for the meat of the presentation, we're gonna be talking about those advanced tips, tricks, strategies, the things that you'll want to be armed with in order to increase precision and lower costs across the platform. Finally, I'll give you some of the formulas that help me when I'm taking data outside of campaign manager. And working with it inside of a dashboard or inside of Excel or Google sheets so that you become a superhuman at analysis. Alright. Without further ado, let's hit it. You may already know a good bit about me. I'm AJ Wilcox. I'm the founder of b two link dot com. Been working with LinkedIn ads for, like, eleven years at this point. Absolutely love them. I live in the state of Utah in the United States with my beautiful wife, my five kids, and I love anything off road, outdoors, hiking, anything with an engine, all that. So first off, when you're using LinkedIn's targeting, especially in an advanced way, you need to understand the dataset that LinkedIn is working with. So first off, I want you to understand the difference between explicit and implicit targeting. And here's the concept. Explicit targeting is anything that you tell LinkedIn about yourself in your profile. So for instance, you tell them what your geography is, where you live, mean, technically, you tell them what company you work for and the company has explicitly said, here's our company size or what our industry is. But, you know, it's it's done through the company, but you're still explicitly telling them. Skills are explicit, you go and actually put a particular skill in your profile. At least this is mostly true. We'll cover how this might be different later on. But then you have implicit targeting. Which is the kinds of targeting that LinkedIn implies about you because of other stuff that's in your profile. So for instance, something like job function or seniority. LinkedIn looks at your profile where it sees a job title, it sees where you're located, and it's going to attempt to use that to define what your job function is, which is which department do you work in in your job, and what level of seniority are you in that job? They don't tell us how they do this. It's a little bit of a black box, but another example of implicit targeting would be like your interests. So LinkedIn understands what your interests are because of things that you engage with in the news feed or things that you may post about or things you may comment. One little caveat here is that if you're a Bing user, they actually look at your Bing search history to define more about who you are and what you're interested in, which probably isn't a lot of people, but if you are a Bing user, they're taking those keywords and using them to create your identity around your interests. Let's talk about some targeting nuances. For instance, when you're using company size as a targeting method, it's helpful to understand that you can work at multiple companies concurrently. So for instance, if you work at one company that is size one through ten employees, and another company that size, let's say, two hundred to five hundred. When you're using company size targeting, if they choose anywhere in that range, you're gonna be included. Something else that's helpful to understand is that LinkedIn only knows company sizes for companies that it has a company page for. So if you're going after certain types of people who may not be attached to a company page, company size is not going to be a good targeting method to reach them. This is mostly smaller companies. It's mostly smaller companies who don't have a marketing team who would think to actually create a company page and then define who that company size is. But if you're smart, this actually probably works to your advantage as well. Because if you assume that there's probably, let's say, thirty percent of profiles out there who aren't attached to a company, maybe the company exists and they say that they work there, but since there's no company page created, it can't actually link. So that person is not able to be found through company size targeting. So what you can do and this is especially if you want to target smaller companies, not larger. Instead of just explicitly saying, I want to target companies that are between, you know, zero to fifty employees, instead flip it around and use exclusions. So now you're gonna say, I want to exclude all companies larger than fifty one employees. So what you're left with is obviously the smaller companies, those from sizes zero to fifty, but you're also left with the unknowns. The ones that LinkedIn doesn't know what size of company they work for because they're not attached to a company page, who happen to be some of the least competitive individuals on the platform to reach. So you can get costs lower when you go to reach them. So try this out the next time that you wanna target smaller companies. I mentioned that we can have concurrent positions on LinkedIn. That means you can work at multiple places. So if you are targeting specifically people with a VP level seniority at company sizes fifty to two hundred, for instance, it's totally possible that your VP seniority could come from them at one position that they're at, and their company size of fifty to two hundred is coming from a different company that they work at. So be aware, this is how it works. Lots of people work either multiple positions, or have a side hustle going on, so just be aware that this happens. We also talked about how job function and seniority are derived from the job title, it's actually a combination of the job title and the industry, and I think the location. There were three things. I'm trying to remember what all three But this is the reason why you can't layer job seniority plus job title on top of each other. You may have had one of these in your targeting, and then when you go into add additional layers onto your targeting, you might be curious why some of these options are grayed out. That's because that they are a derived from each other. So of course, you can't layer multiple things that were derived from it. Alright. Let's talk specifically about job titles. One thing that is highly misunderstood about LinkedIn's job titles is that they roll up to something called super titles, and we can't control this at all. Because there are so many titles out there, Linkedin has grouped certain titles together under a certain word. So for instance, if you go out and type in a different title, let's say, Salesforce administrator, you're actually gonna capture quite a few people who didn't have exactly the job title Salesforce administrator, they may have had something relatively close, but every so often LinkedIn makes a mistake here. And because LinkedIn will actually group many different job titles together into a single super title that is what you would actually be targeting when you go and type a title in, you would think that you're targeting a specific title that you want LinkedIn to pull, but in actuality, you're either typing a specific title that LinkedIn's going to include the entire super title along with it, or you are typing a super title and LinkedIn's going to be including many more job titles into it. One example we found where this was especially problematic, for some reason, the job title of marketing consultant actually rolls up to chief marketing officer as a title. So what happened is we were targeting CMOs we kept seeing traffic coming to our ads from marketing consultants. So we went and added a negative, an exclusion for the job title of marketing consultant, and as we did this, our whole audience size dropped to zero. That was how we could tell that, oh, boy, when you are targeting chief marketing officer, it's also randomly including marketing consultants, which I don't think is the same thing, but it's an example of how sometimes titles could give you some unexpected results. There are twenty three thousand just over that known titles out there in the resources that you'll see I've included a spreadsheet that we've pulled directly from the API that show you all twenty three thousand available job titles. This could be helpful for you in planning or just for your curiosity, but check out that that spreadsheet. You'll also see some other targeting methods that LinkedIn has so you can dive deeper into them. So let's talk about that nuance I've mentioned earlier about skills. Early on, LinkedIn made it so you could have up to fifty skills in a single profile, which is great. But they also said, if someone doesn't claim skills, we're gonna look at people like them, and we're going to assume some of their skills. So let's say if I only filled out twenty five of my skills, they would look at someone who has a similar job title to me, and they would select some of the same skills that person has and add them automatically to my profile. Now, this hasn't happened in quite some time, so it's pretty rare to see skills that are still sticking around, but there could be some vestiges of it left over. So be aware as you're using skills targeting. You might be targeting people with skills that they didn't actually sign up. Next, let's talk about audience expansion and LinkedIn's Lookalike model. As it turns out, they're exactly the same or at least very close to it. What originally happened is LinkedIn created this audience expansion model that goes out and finds from the people that you're targeting, it goes to find people who are maybe similar but outside of your targeting. Then obviously feeling some pressure from Facebook, who created Lookalike targeting and it worked so well, LinkedIn decided they had to come out with their own. So what they did is they ended up using pretty much the same algorithm that is used for audience expansion, and they made that lookalike. The reason why I like using lookalike is because I can create a lookalike of an audience and run it on its own. And that means I'm gonna get stats. I'm gonna learn, does this work? How quality is this audience as they make it into my sales funnel? But with audience expansion, you can't do that. Audience expansion is that box that you tick inside of a campaign, and all it does is just adds more people to your existing campaign You can't tell which of those people you actually wanted, you were explicitly targeting, and those who were added by LinkedIn. So I don't recommend audience expansion in the least. But I would recommend testing out lookalike audiences every now and let's talk about overlapping targeting. In some of the other courses, I've recommended targeting the same audience multiple ways. So for instance, you might have one campaign targeting the right job titles, And another campaign, you might be targeting skills along with seniority, for instance, for those same job titles. So the big concern pops up, well, if I'm targeting the same person in two different campaigns, am I bidding against myself? Am I shooting myself in the foot and making myself pay more for both of these clicks? Well, the nice answer is no. When you just have two campaigns that are bidding on the same audience member, you're not bidding against yourself. You won't bid yourself up in the auction. What is happening though, is LinkedIn has to decide, hey, there's this ad inventory that just opened up that you are now eligible for, and it has to say, which of these two campaigns is going to win the auction here. And so you will notice when you have overlapping targeting, that one of your campaigns may cannibalize many of the impressions from the other, which is okay. It's not optimal, but I actually like it better. Than just having one campaign hoping that I get everyone who's relevant and then having that one campaign get all the impressions. The other thing is that there's going to be overlap between those audiences. And I think that's totally fine because there's gonna be enough of non overlapping people to still give your campaign some flavor. So here's what I'm thinking. If you have this example, one campaign targeting job titles. Let's say it's marketing director job titles, and you have another one that is targeting director, job seniority with marketing related skills. So these are technically the same kind of person And a lot of them are actually going to be shared between both of those audiences, but enough are not going to be recognized. Either LinkedIn didn't understand their job title so they got left out of the job title targeting, or maybe they forgot to add skills like that or the specific skills you mentioned. And so there is going to be some level of personality left in that audience. So when I go and do an analysis, of all of these campaigns. Let's say my ad that I care about here has a point six percent click through rate from job titles, and it has a point four percent click through rate from skills. The things that I can understand from that are, oh, it looks like my job titles people tend to be more engaged. So I can kind of draw up what kind of personality I think that targeting has. And I might look at something like skills and say, They look less engaged, but if my cost per MQL or my cost per SQL is similar or lower, I might be okay with having less engagement knowing that they're gonna do better down the the funnel. Or maybe I decide, oh, it looks like my skills targeting is too broad. Maybe I need to bid that down or even shut it off entirely. These are the kinds of things you can figure out by having separate campaigns, even if they do have some overlapping targets. Here's a rule of thumb for you as you're trying to calculate what size of company should I be targeting. Your rule of thumb is that each employee is usually worth about a hundred thousand dollars in revenue to a company per year. So for example, If you have a company that has fifty million dollars in revenue per year, if you take that fifty million and you divide it by the one hundred thousand dollars per employee per year. That tells you that that company is probably gonna have about five hundred employees. And the same works in opposite as well. If you have a company that you know the size, let's say it's ten thousand people and you want to calculate the amount of revenue that that company is likely earning, you can do the same thing. You multiply that number of employees times the one hundred thousand dollar per employee, and that gives you one billion dollars per year. And something that's cool, LinkedIn actually in the last few years has given us access to revenue targeting. So we don't have to just use company size targeting anymore. But you should know that it tends to be a lot more accurate when you're looking at larger sizes of companies rather than when you're looking at small companies. Small companies, they don't have to publicly report their revenue. So because of that, that data is kind of hard to get. LinkedIn can't just partner with someone to get that. My guess is they're probably partnering with someone like Crunchbase who has data about sizes of companies, but don't know for sure. They haven't published that. So if your target audience is these smaller privately held companies, chances are you're not gonna want to use this targeting. You may want to use the targeting we talk about earlier where we're excluding all larger company sizes. Alright. Let's jump into some targeting hacks. These are always really fun. When we're using matched audience lists, which are one of the most powerful features on LinkedIn, we have a couple different options. We can target by company list. We can also target by person list. Individuals. Recently, LinkedIn has rolled out the ability to when you click on a company list within your matched audiences, they give this whole detailed company level stats. It's kind of like an ABM dashboard, which is really cool, and I'm really glad they gave it to You can even export the stats to send to someone on your sales team for instance about which companies are the most engaging. But this is only for matched audiences you can't get this level of data if you're not specifically targeting by a list. If you're not using this list to target, The best you can do is look inside of the LinkedIn demographics and get the twenty companies who've engaged with your ads the most during that time period. When you actually go to create these lists though, it's helpful to know what are some of the most advantageous fields to use. We found that if you include company name, Obviously, sometimes you're gonna get the company name exactly the way that LinkedIn has it written, sometimes not. And so it it may be difficult to match. But if you can upload the URL for the company, specifically like their web address, that's really helpful. And even better is if you have a link to the company page profile on LinkedIn. And obviously, it's gonna take a little bit of work if all you have is a list of names to go and find which domain names and which are their LinkedIn profile URLs, but if you did have that information somehow, you're probably gonna end up with a really solid match rate. And of course, if you did actually pull those list of companies directly from LinkedIn, you're probably gonna have a one hundred percent match rate, but LinkedIn doesn't make it easy to grab those. What about contacts? Well, one of the coolest hacks that we've found, most of the time we've used Facebooks and Google's version of this, it really revolves around the email address. You have to have someone's email to match. On LinkedIn, we don't really though, which actually makes it really powerful for us as advertisers because we can reach the right people without ever having grabbed their email address from somewhere. The way that you do this is if you have these four fields, their first name, their last name, their company name, and their job title. And all of this is public information on their LinkedIn profile, So if you have someone go and get it for instance, then you're gonna make a list that's really powerful and matches at a hundred percent or at least near. If you are using groups targeting, which I personally love, there's a little bit of an issue that we get into with the way that LinkedIn suggests things. LinkedIn's ad system was not meant to be able to to surface a whole lot of things to us in our targeting. So what happens is you type in a keyword into the group search, and LinkedIn's going to surface the top twenty or I don't know how they do it. But there's they're gonna surface twenty groups that fit that specification, that contain that keyword. But what happens if there's actually more like forty or eighty or a hundred groups who all have that same keyword in them, you won't know because LinkedIn won't actively suggest them for you. So what you do, there's a little bit of a hack. You go to actually do the the search. You can select all twenty of those for instance. And then once you've exhausted those twenty, what you do is type the keyword, do a space, and then you run through the entire alphabet. So keyword, space, the letter a. And then LinkedIn's gonna suggest a whole bunch more to you. Another twenty, you select the ones you care out of that. Then delete the a, type b. Go back through and again, select the twenty that you're you're looking for. What happens is and this is this has never failed me. You'll end up having so many groups that you've added to it that you can actually get near the group's one hundred limit. And I'll run through and show you an example of this. So let's say I go to create a blank brand new campaign. I'm just gonna choose my objective. And move down here, I always uncheck the enable audience expansion. But I come here to audience attributes and target interests and traits, and then groups, and now I can target. You could imagine if you wanted to target marketers, there's probably a lot of groups with marketing or marketer in them. So I'm gonna try this. I can type marketing. And if I select all twenty of these, oh, actually looks like they've narrowed this down to ten. They just have ten suggestions that come up. And now after I've selected those, it gives me a healthy audience size but that's without any other targeting criteria that I've layered on top. So I could come here and do space a, and then again look at all these that are unselected. I can go in and target a whole bunch of new marketing groups. Same thing. Delete a. Type b. And again, Some of them still stayed through that I've already checked before, but now it's gonna surface a few more. I'll just go through one more example of this. Marketing c, and again, there's a lot of marketing c here, and I'm definitely growing my audience size. Again, with any sort of targeting on LinkedIn, you can have up to one hundred of anything. So that's the cool groups trick. I actually can't take credit for this one. This was taught to me by the very first LinkedIn rep I had back in twenty eleven, and she taught me several of the the little tips and tricks that even after the platform itself has been refreshed now several times, this still works because they never fixed the ability to have it suggest more than just ten of anything. There are some things that you'll need to understand about LinkedIn's back end system, the way the whole platform works. One of the biggest trip ups that we see is that if you create a new account on LinkedIn, no matter how big of a budget you have, LinkedIn has this invisible ceiling or this invisible limit behind the scenes, and they won't let the account spend more than a hundred dollars per day. And this is really frustrating when it happens because if you have, let's say, ten campaigns that are all set to be able to spend twenty dollars a piece. You're like, hey, it's halfway through the day. I've spent exactly a hundred dollars. I should be able to spend two hundred and it's not moving at all. So what you'll end up doing is you'll say, we must not be bidding competitively enough. So you go in and increase your budgets and increase your bids and then you notice it still doesn't do anything. Then all of a sudden magically after UTC midnight time, all of a sudden the account will start spending again and this time it will spend your entire hundred dollars very quickly because you increased your budgets and you've bid now more aggressively. And this whole cycle could happen for quite a while it's really frustrating when it happens because you've now just paid LinkedIn too much. You're bidding too aggressively so you're paying more than you should for every click. So if you understand that new accounts have this, you can actually reach out to LinkedIn support who can help raise that limit. So you tell them, here's what we actually want to spend, and then the the account will raise an increase really steadily from there. As long as LinkedIn is getting paid for this, as long as your account doesn't go delinquent or anything, they're gonna keep trusting you, and letting your account spend more naturally. But when you're very first getting out the gate with a significant budget, it can be really difficult The way you can spot this, the way that I learned to recognize this is if I see an account spending exactly I mean, it might be within some sense, but like every day, it's only spending a hundred dollars even though it was it had more of a budget to spend than that, then I go, oh, I wonder if this is that invisible ceiling that they've put on there. I don't know what LinkedIn calls this internally, but when I talk to support, I tell them, hey, the account limit is being hit. And we need to raise that because we actually wanna spend significantly more. I get asked a whole lot about the ad rotation settings on LinkedIn. And a lot of times, LinkedIn tries to hide options that I actually really like, but in this case, they've done a good job. They've hidden this option for ad rotation settings, the only way you can get to it is when you're inside of the campaign on campaign manager, in the add section, and then you find this little gear here. So the reason why it's actually good that they've hidden this, is most advertisers don't need it. If you just use the default option here, optimize for performance, this is what I recommend the vast majority of the The only time I recommend using rotate ads evenly is when you're using sponsored messaging ad formats, and LinkedIn even started having them use that option by default. So there really is no reason that I can think of why you'd wanna come and mess with this option. The way that these options work is that LinkedIn is going to favor the add variation that gets the highest relevancy score. Which is actually great. If you have two ad creatives that are running in a campaign, one of them over time is going to cost more. To show. And so what you're telling LinkedIn is go ahead and show the one that's going to get me the most performance for the least amount of cost. And it's not like it's a total either or. It might be like one of your ad variations get sixty percent of the impressions and the other one gets forty. This can become an issue if you have more creatives in a campaign. So let's say you put five different creatives in that one campaign, One of those is gonna get sixty percent of the impressions. One's probably gonna get thirty, one's gonna get ten, and then two add variations get zero impressions or let's say they get like six impressions over the course of a week. Obviously, that's not enough to actually test and find out, like, if those variations would have worked. So when you run these campaigns as optimized for the best performance, it's going to get you more delivery at lower cost. The other option, the rotate adds evenly option, I lovingly refer to it as the charge me more and show me less button. And the reason why is whenever you select that option, it doesn't show your ads evenly. What it actually does is it enters both variations into the auction evenly. But of course we know that in the auction, one of those variations has a higher relevancy score than the other one, which means the higher relevancy score is going to win at more wins in the auction, more impressions at lower cost. So if all of a sudden you're forcing the campaign to enter the poor performer into the auction just as often as your winner, what ends up happening is you'll see your amount of impressions drop down because now when you used to be winning a hundred impressions per day, now you're only able to win like seventy of them, which, you know, isn't great if you're trying to scale. But then those impressions that you did win from the other variation, you're gonna pay a higher cost per click for them because it didn't have as high of a relevancy score in the auction. And that's why I call it the charge me more and show me less button. I don't recommend using this. I mentioned that example of having five creatives in a campaign for a specific reason. This was on purpose. This is because LinkedIn reps will oftentimes recommend this to advertisers like, hey, we suggest you have five ad creatives in a campaign. The reason for this advice is actually really simple. It's because LinkedIn wants to make more money. So here's how this works. LinkedIn has a frequency cap for sponsored content that if you have two or fewer ads in a campaign, your ad can only be shown each individual member on LinkedIn once every twenty four hours. So let's show this here on the chart. If you have one creative in a campaign, it's eligible to be seen by each person on LinkedIn, one impression every twenty four hours. The same thing if you have two creatives. But as soon as you have three creatives in a campaign, it changes the rules for how the frequency cap works, and it starts working with something that LinkedIn calls their five and forty eight rule. And it moves to the number of creatives that you have in a campaign is the same number of times that your ad can be shown to each unique person on LinkedIn every forty eight hours. So if you have three ads in a campaign, someone who's really active on LinkedIn, might see three of your ads in a forty eight hour period, which is fifty percent more often than they would see it otherwise. And then if you have four ads in a campaign, you can now show four impressions per forty eight hours, which is twice per day, which is twice as often as they would normally get to see it. Same thing up to five. Five creatives in a campaign will show five impressions to the most active members in every forty eight hour period. This is really where it stops though. If you try to go further than that, like let's put six creatives or seven creatives, it still stays. You can only show five times in a forty eight hour period. So we understand why LinkedIn recommends this. The more ads they have in a campaign means the more impressions they can go after, which means the more competition they have on the ad network for each of those ad inventory parts means that all of us pay more and LinkedIn makes more money. I mean, I don't like paying LinkedIn extra money. I don't like bidding ourselves up in the auction. But even worse, if you have an audience where you're showing the most active people on LinkedIn your ads multiple times per day, there's gonna be a certain segment of your population that you can't tell from the rest of your population who has is saturating by your ads much faster than average. In the research we've done, usually, you can run an ad for twenty seven to thirty three days before an audience starts to get sick of it. And that's based off of each member only being able to see your ad, like, once per day. But now imagine, let's say there's twenty percent of your audience who is able to see your ads much faster, you may get halfway through the month and and wonder why are my ads saturating or why did I really stop getting impressions It's because that twenty percent of your audience hates you now. They they've been totally inundated with with your ads. They feel like too much. And then you have this other part of your audience that is probably acting normally, but all you see is an average of them. So my recommendation is almost always have two ads per campaign, run an AB test. That's the best way to do it. Alright. Let's move into some of Linkedin's gotchas. First of all, in the definitions department, there are some definitions you probably didn't know that you didn't know. So let's walk through those. First off, video views. For ads, they count a video view if the ad has been playing at least two seconds. While it was at least fifty percent on the screen, which is not hard to do. But if you're tracking your organic metrics, organic views of videos, you might be like, wow, why is it so hard to get organic views? That is because the organic definition of a video view is that it was on the same screen for three seconds. I'm guessing that's also has to be fifty percent on your screen, but I don't know. They haven't been that upfront about the metrics organically. Next, LinkedIn actually announced in October of twenty twenty two that they were changing their definition of what a one hundred percent video completion rate was. So it's helpful to understand there are two different definitions that are floating around in LinkedIn as you're analyzing your video ads. First off, is that the one hundred percent completion rate Linked it actually says it's anywhere between ninety seven to one hundred percent. This is the number of people who made it to at least ninety seven percent of a video even if they skipped ahead to it. They didn't have to actually watch the whole thing, divided by the number of plays, not views, So we talked about how video views are it had to be on their screen for at least two seconds, but a completion is actually divided by the number of plays. And the definition for plays is any start of a video. So essentially, the video loaded on their screen and then started playing, whether it was only twenty percent on their screen or only played for one second. None of that matters. Lincoln is is tracking the number of times that that video actually started. You could also call it starts. The definition on the other hand for view rate because you're obviously gonna care about your view rate of videos. This is different This is the number of views that was people who were on watching the video for at least two seconds with it fifty percent on your screen. This is views divided by the number of impressions, not plays. An impression just means that the ad loaded in their feed But you could have had just a placeholder for the video sitting there for an impression, but for a play, the video fully loaded and began playing. So the definitions are only slightly different here, but it's helpful to understand that if you go and do look at both of these rates, if something doesn't look right, it could just be the definition. Linkton said that they adjusted their definition for completion percentage, because they were conforming to industry standard, but they didn't change anything with their view rate formula. So You can just take that into account yourselves. So moving along from video, now we come to sponsored messaging. Clicks are really misleading with sponsored messaging. Because your campaign manager platform is going to default usually to performance as the metric that you're using to look at at all of the other metrics. The category. And if you look at clicks under your sponsored messaging under performance, your click and your opens are actually the same thing. And you can tell this by if you look at your click through rate number, it will always be exactly the same as your open rate number. Which is not helpful to me. In fact, it feels really misleading. LinkedIn took that into account, and now there's a different breakdown instead of looking at your performance metrics, you can look at it through sponsored messaging, then they'll actually tell you what your opens and your clicks are. But this has been one of the biggest problems I've heard from new advertisers who will come to me and they'll they'll say, I have a fifty percent click through rate on my sponsored messaging ads. This is incredible, but Oh, and I'm I'm paying less than a dollar per click, but then they're scratching their heads going, wait, why is my cost per conversion so high? It's because they were looking at the reported opens as clicks, which definitely not the case. If you're pulling your sponsored messaging data out into excel or into a dashboard, here's the definition that I use for a click. So what you can do is take all reported clicks and add action clicks, sometimes it's called, or it might be sponsored messaging clicks, add those together, and then subtract the reported number of opens. What that's gonna do is across all of your dataset, it's gonna give you the resulting number of only clicks. So if you have clicks coming from sponsored content, and clicks coming from sponsored messaging. If you use this formula to determine them, then all clicks will be exactly under the same definition. And if you then use that data to create other metrics like click through rates or cost per click, then they'll all be clean. You you'll be looking at the same data. The next definition that really messes people up is conversions. If you look at the conversions column within campaign manager, you may be a little bit confused. You might see a number that's much higher than what you'd expect. So what I recommend doing, instead of looking at conversions under your performance, switch your performance breakdown to conversions and leads, then LinkedIn will show you all three columns next to each other, conversions, view through conversions, and click through conversions. If you ask me, click through conversions are the ones that actually matter because that means that within the defined window that you've set, it could be one day, it could be seven days or whatever. Someone clicked on your ad and then took the desired action on the landing page that you wanted them to. That shows that your ad really did lead to it. If you threw conversion on the other hand just means that your ad somewhere somehow showed up in their news feed as they were scrolling, and then LinkedIn took the credit as they ended up converting off of some other channel. Let's say you're running retargeting or Google search or something, they come and convert later, and then Lincoln's claiming that credit under the conversions call. So if you look at conversions, it is adding both your view through conversions and your click through conversions together. And so when I take the data out of LinkedIn to start doing analysis, I actually only bring in my click conversions. I do care about view through conversions. It's helpful to see, but usually larger numbers there just means that I'm also marketing on other channels and I'm reaching more of the right people. So it's a confidence booster in what I'm doing that it's the right thing, but the view through conversions don't tell me that my LinkedIn ads are doing a good job. It tells me that I'm actually just serving impressions to the right people, which I don't think needs to play in. In b to b, we have this really special thing, which is We work to drive a lead, but once someone fills out a form, it shows up in the CRM. So anytime LinkedIn is is showing us conversion numbers within campaign manager, I think it's always good practice, smart practice to go log in to your CRM and make sure that they make sense. If LinkedIn says that you got seven leads, do you actually have seven new records inside your CRM that can check you and make sure that you're actually looking at the right things, but it's pretty embarrassing to me, I think, when an ad manager goes to their client because they looked in the conversions column and they say, we drove fifteen conversions this week and the client goes, well, why do I only see four conversions, you know, four names in my my CRM? It's pretty embarrassing for us as ad managers. So it's good to sync those definitions as closely as you can. Alright. Let's move into some advanced tips and tricks for as you're in the platform, working away doing things, you're gonna start moving the needle. The first is gonna be in retargeting. The website retargeting inside of LinkedIn has been weakened due to the iOS fourteen point five update, but it's definitely still worth setting up. In the past, I've told people about LinkedIn's website retargeting, like, it's just not all that worth it. You have to have at least three hundred people in an audience when you go to actually advertise to them, they're relatively expensive. They can't even have higher costs per click than your cold campaigns. And that audience disappears after a hundred and eighty days. So it just doesn't seem like it makes that much sense. But that being said, it's still worth setting up and it's still worth having a retargeting audience built. The earlier you do this, the better. If you never do end up using the audience, no big deal. At least you have it. But if you ever do want to use it or you you can add other retargeting audiences together to create one kind of mega retargeting audience, you can do that as well. Let's talk about lead gen form converters. We can go into matched audiences and we can create retargeting audiences around those who have opened the lead form and submitted. And we can also create an audience around those who have just submitted the lead form. So what I like to do is I go into my targeting. If I wanna just show ads to people who have converted from converting on a lead form, I can target those who did both an open and a submit, and then I will exclude anyone who submitted. Then there's a cool hack where you can re target those who have opened a lead generation form but have not yet completed it. To do this, what you do is you go into your matched audiences and you create an audience for those who have done a lead form open and submit, and then you create another one just for those who have submitted the lead generation form. And then you open a campaign where you target those who have opened and submitted, and you exclude those who have submitted. This is gonna leave you just those who've opened but haven't yet taken that next action. They were obviously close enough to the finish line. They just never quite crossed it. So I like retargeting audiences to remind them of what it was that they were looking at or maybe even just reminding them of the same piece of content, but you're changing your ad to show different benefits or things they might not have taken into account, these are things that are gonna help push them over that that finish line. Okay. Then we have video ads. It used to be that we could retarget a view on a video ad, which was really cool. That was anyone who watched at least for two seconds, but then LinkedIn took that option away from us. So the next closest that we can get to getting as many people into our retargeting audience, as possible through video ads, is we can retarget anyone who's watched at least twenty five percent of a video. So if you have a video ad that's somewhere around eight or nine seconds, a twenty five percent view is gonna be about two seconds, which effectively gets us the same thing. It means you can still retarget those who counted basically as of you. On the some more retargeting tricks, we have single image ads, which we can now do retargeting around, which is great. It's one of the big things that changed about LinkedIn ads back in twenty twenty two. You can go and create audiences for anyone who's interacted in any way with a a single image sponsored content. That's cool. You can also do it for chargeable clicks, meaning anyone who took an action that you paid for. That means if this ad was a website visit objective. The only thing that would qualify as a chargeable click would be those who clicked on your destination URL to go to where you're you're trying to take them. If you're running engagement or brand awareness, a chargeable click is any sort of click on that ad. It could be a click to the company page It could be liking or commenting on it. So keep that in mind as you're you're considering what sort of objectives you're running. Next, we have the ability to retarget those who have visited our company page. I recommend setting all of these up beforehand so that these audiences are ready for you to start advertising to. If someone makes it to your company page, chances are they are actually taking you seriously as a company or maybe a friend of theirs works there and they're trying to find out more about it, but there's a lot more intent of someone being on your company page than, you know, looking at a post or whatever. Then there's a really cool hack around using lead generation forms on LinkedIn. One of the fields that you can include in your forms is the public profile URL. And what we found is Conversion rates tend to be pretty high when we are asking for someone's public profile URL because they're like, well, someone could just look me up anyway. It's all public information. That doesn't seem to be giving away much. But rather than in a form asking for their first name, last name, email, their job title, their company name, their company size, any of that stuff, instead you can just ask for potentially just email address and public profile URL, Then when this information gets to sales, if they're willing to, they can go and hop on that person's profile and collect their first name, last name, company name, their job title, their skills, the groups that they are part of. I mean, anything that you can get off of someone's profile. This is a really cool way of increasing your conversion rates. And then you can get the other fields either manually like I talked about, through an enrichment service. There are ways of obtaining data from LinkedIn through scraping because we're official LinkedIn partners I can't recommend using scraping because they're they're all one hundred percent against LinkedIn's terms of service. If you do use scraping, there's a chance LinkedIn could figure it out. And end up disabling your profile. You wouldn't want that to disrupt your advertising. You wouldn't want that to disrupt any of your employees. So I tend to discourage it, but it is technically possible. Alright. Let's talk about some of the less efficient ad formats. We have carousel ads that routinely have costs per click that are twenty percent higher than single image ads. So I try to avoid carousel ads whenever possible. The next is video ads. I realized that the measuring the cost per click of sponsored content and the cost per click of a video ad they're they're very different things. It's like apples and oranges. But if you're just looking at a cost per click and a cost per lead, Running video ads are generally gonna be about twenty percent higher costs over using single image. So if cost and efficiency are your only goal, you should probably stick with single image. But anytime that you have really good performing video creative, it's just so much easier to build that no like and trust factor through video. I like to say, now probably in the first five minutes of taking one of my courses, you probably learned to know like and trust me more than if you read, like, five of my white papers. So it's a lot easier to get to know someone through video, so don't count video out entirely. The next here is that document ads. They generally perform worse than using just a single image ad, with a lead form pointing to that same piece of content. I had really high hopes for document ads. I was really hopeful that they would do well. They work well as document posts organically on in, but I I just I haven't seen that much success with them. So at first blush, I would say avoid, but always test into them. And if any of you have a lot of success with any of these ad formats, I'd love to know about. And just a note on ad approval, Many of you listen to the podcast. If you listen to episode fifty one, we talked about if ads are getting constantly disapproved, you could go and launch that ad on the company page organically, and then boost that post through campaign manager, and a lot of times that gets around their checks. For what they would normally disapprove of. After I published that podcast episode, LinkedIn came back to me and said, we want you to issue a retraction. That's not actually correct. And then they said, can you provide examples of when this has worked for you so we could go check? I didn't actually provide examples. I don't Nestly want them to patch any loopholes that I've been able to use. But just recently, we have seen that there are some ads that are are being disapproved even though they're boosted. Or now through boosting, they still will go into the approval queue. So it it may be hit or miss. Now, I've talked a little bit about the analysis things like my definition for clicks that I use to unify all different ad formats. So we've covered this a little bit, but we're gonna get even geekier here. When you take the the data from LinkedIn and go to analyze it elsewhere, Maybe you're taking this data through Supermetrics into Google sheets to do analysis or you're exporting right from campaign manager into Excel to do analysis. Or maybe you're using Supermetrics or or the API or something to push data directly into a business intelligence platform or a visualization platform. Something like Google's Looker studio, these are some little helps that are gonna help you do more with the analysis side of actually using LinkedIn's data. The first is when you're doing budget prediction, you need to understand that weekdays and weekend days act very differently. Usually, we see that that weekend days only perform about sixty percent as well with impressions and with clicks as a normal weekday does. So if you are then predicting how a month is gonna go, you need to look at your weekend days and discount them by usually about forty percent. There is a caveat here if your week ends are spending the same as your weekdays, it means you're probably bidding too high, but a lot of times I will go into excel and actually predict out what my budget spend is gonna be by the end of the month, given certain changes. So the way that I do this, I take the most recent ten weekdays and the most recent ten week end days, and I'll do an average to see what is my average number of impressions, my average number of clicks, my average amount of spend on those days, and then I can then use that data to create this formula. I can say, my monthly spend is going to equal my remaining weekdays times my average spend on a weekday plus my remaining weekend days left in the month times the average that a weekend day usually spends. And when I put this formula together, it's gonna spit out how much it's predicting that I'm gonna spend by the end of the month. So this can be really helpful for for budget modeling and prediction. If you use shape dot I o, They're a LinkedIn partner who all they do is budgeting. They're just gonna spit out a straight graph of this for you. I don't know if that's exactly the same formula they use. There's might be quite a bit more sophisticated, but they've got a cool graph and trend line that you can check out. If you're using Supermetric, We actually use all of the above. I I love to use all the LinkedIn tools I can get my hands on. You can actually build your own budget visualization inside of looker studio or Google sheets, and that's something that I like to do as well. We do this because it's really difficult on LinkedIn, to actually predict what your spend's gonna be, but in advertising agencies, predicting that we're gonna be close to a client's budget is really, really important. In fact, I was looking at insurance really early on when I was starting b two linked, and I could get all kinds of business insurance. But the one coverage that I couldn't get was covering us if we overspent a client's budget. So it seems like the biggest exposure, the biggest risk to an ad agency is overspending a budget, meaning this data was really helpful for me to to dive into and make sure I had a good feel Another big weakness that LinkedIn ads has is we can't target by device, but that doesn't mean that you can't actually analyze by device, and see how things are going. If you go and look in your analytics at the traffic that's coming from each campaign, it can be helpful to do things like look at text ads and dynamic ads campaigns because the majority of that traffic should be coming from desktop because those are desktop only ad formats. So if you see a lot of mobile usage there, maybe analytics is wrong or it might be something to to look at, but compare that to anything coming from sponsored content. From your sponsored messaging. Those are ad formats that are probably going to be eighty percent mobile with maybe twenty percent desktop. What we do is every ad is going to have UTM parameters or URL tracking parameters inside of it. So we can go look inside of analytics and say anything with UTM source equals LinkedIn, and UTM medium equals CPC or paid social or something like that. Show us the breakdown of mobile versus desktop. This can give you a good idea of what your traffic makeup looks like. Now there's not a whole lot you can do with that. Because you can't have different URL parameters based off of what device someone's using, and we can't then go and target on LinkedIn. To get more of mobile or more of desktop traffic, but at least it can help for visualization purposes. K, this is a task you probably won't want to do. But it's totally possible. The daily patterns and the weekly patterns that we see on LinkedIn are pretty incredible. They and they're actually really repeatable. When people jump on LinkedIn, it's oftentimes at the beginning of the workday. And at the end of the workday, we see a drop off where they're not on LinkedIn as much. So you can go through a process of something that we call hourly sampling. That's every hour you go and make note of campaign statistics or even download from LinkedIn like do an export of the data, then you can stitch that data together and figure out what happened each hour of the day. So for instance, if one campaign had five hundred impressions and you checked it at four PM and then you check at five PM and now it has four hundred and sixty impressions, you can do a a very simple just subtract and you find out, oh, from the four o'clock to five o'clock hour, we got sixty impressions. You could do the same thing with clicks, the same thing with spend. You can find out what time of day gives you the cheapest costs per click. Or the most traffic or the highest amount of reach with impressions. If you do this process and we do this with all of our clients, so if you want this done, come work with us. But if you look at just your sponsored content impressions, it'll tell you your first logins of the day over each different hour, you can find what time people log in for the first time. That's because sponsored content by default is only showing once per day or, you know, once per twenty four hour period. So if you're looking at just what hour did impressions really stack up, you can see this traffic pattern throughout the day. If you're looking at text ads on the other hand or same thing could be said for dynamic ads, they really have high frequency caps, which means you can show to the same person repeatedly and that means if you're looking at your impressions by hour, that stacked impressions will show you what hours of the day people tend to be the most active on desktop. They load the the most number of pages in their session. And of course, once you have this data, you can graph it to picture, like, what does my average person look like? Do they wake up at six AM and and check their phone before stumbling you know, stumbling out of bed and and into their office, or do they really start to get active on LinkedIn around nine AM when they get into their office? These are all things that you can see, and this actually would have been really interesting to analyze during the COVID pandemic when everyone started working from home. But all awesome data together if you've got the heart for it. Thanks for sticking around for the hardest core of all of the knowledge that I can teach you about LinkedIn ads.
