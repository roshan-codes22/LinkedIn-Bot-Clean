Summary:
LinkedIn Ads has taken a major leap forward with the launch of 
Objective-Based Advertising (OBA)
. According to Amita Paul, Product Manager at LinkedIn, the platform now starts with your business goal—like brand awareness or conversions—and tailors the entire campaign setup around it. This means simpler creation, smarter tools, and fewer distractions. You’ll only see the ad formats and features that directly support your objective, making it easier to build campaigns that actually perform.
With OBA, metrics now focus on outcomes, not just clicks. The experience is fully reimagined—with live previews, forecasting tools, and intuitive targeting. Built around the “Three E’s” framework (Effectiveness, Experience, Emotion), Campaign Manager is designed to make advertisers feel productive and confident. Even more enhancements are coming soon, including real-time feedback and in-product help. Now’s the time to dive in and build campaigns centered around what really matters: your success.
