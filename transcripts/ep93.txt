LinkedIn ‘s official marketing partner program. Who are these partners? And how do you become one? What are the requirements? We cover the LinkedIn partner program on this week’s episode of the LinkedIn ads show.

Illiana Acosta
Welcome to the LinkedIn Ads Show. Here’s your host, AJ Wilcox.

AJ Wilcox
Hey there LinkedIn Ads fanatics, you’ve heard us talk about how we’re an official LinkedIn partner. And you’ve probably used the tools of other partners to manage or report on your LinkedIn Ads initiatives. I met Illiana Acosta , who’s one of the senior managers of the LinkedIn partner team at the B2Believe event that was in November. We talked all about that event on episode 79. And I thought it would be really interesting to bring her on and talk to her all about the program. Many of you have asked me what it takes to become a partner. So this episode is for you. First in the news, Jae Oh, who’s head of ads measurement and audiences at LinkedIn. He wrote an article this month, called What’s New With the Company Engagement report on LinkedIn. For those of you who don’t know, there’s this report that if you go and click on any of your audiences that our company list uploads, or sometimes we call them our ABM lists, if you click on that Companies list, it now takes you to this report called the company engagement report. And this is so cool. If you’re advertising to a list of companies, now you can get all of this analytics and demographics information about who is actually engaging with your ads. It’s way cool. Well, Jae talked about all the new updates that have happened to it. And I wanted to point out the things that I thought were really cool. First off, there’s this company segmentation feature. So now you can dynamically prioritize the accounts that you’re going after in certain campaigns, you can actually create a static list of here are the companies I want to go into which segment. But what’s so exciting to me is the dynamic segmentation, where now you can say every day, I want LinkedIn to go to my list and go just for the companies that have the highest engagement. And let’s show ads specifically to them. And you can have another segment, that’s all about low engagement. So now with your campaigns, you can show different messages to companies that maybe aren’t as engaged so we can try something new. The static segment is actually just a snapshot of the lowest engaged companies. And it’s not going to change. We’ve linked to that article down in the show notes. So go give it a read and check it out. If that’s interesting to you. I wanted to highlight a review left by Craig Sea. And that’s the last name is S E. A. Craig says, “Very insightful and educational. I’m so happy I came across this podcast, I’ve learned a lot from it. Myself, being a beginner, started listening to this podcast. I’ve also started AJ’s course, which is giving me a lot of confidence to get started running my own ads. Great podcast five stars from me.” Craig, thanks so much for heeding the call and leaving that review. I’m so glad that couple of our resources could give you the confidence to begin advertising. You get five stars for me as well. Thanks, Craig. As a reminder, I want to feature you as well. If you haven’t already left us a review, please do. And I’d love to give you a shout out. All right. Without further ado, we’ll go ahead and jump right into the interview. Let’s hit it.

Illiana, I’m so excited to have you here. For those who don’t know, Illiana is a senior manager on the LinkedIn ads business. She supports the LinkedIn Marketing Partners. She’s also the Global Co Chair of the Latino ERG at LinkedIn. Illiana, thanks so much for being here.

Illiana Acosta
Thank you so much for having me. I appreciate the enthusiasm and welcoming me on your show.

AJ Wilcox
You and I actually just met at the B2Believe event not too long ago back in November. Yes. It was awesome to get to hang out with you get to know you a little bit. I was excited to have you on the show because obviously you know so much about this. So give us an introduction to yourself. Tell us about yourself anything that I may not have covered in the intro. Yeah. Well, I was

Illiana Acosta
Well, I was born on a Monday. Oh, wait, no, I won’t go back that far. I have been with LinkedIn for about four and a half years and I have been supporting our channel sales business which is our LinkedIn marketing partners program since day one. So I’ve seen it since its let’s call it infancy stages to now its teenage years where we are operating almost like a mid level startup, if you will, right. It’s like this crazy, awesome, high growth team and business that’s supporting so much of what we’re doing in our ads business to grow our business, but more so ensure that we are driving value for our customers with our marketing partners. In addition to my day job in managing our enterprise partners ad tech team. I am also the global co chair, as you mentioned, our Hispanics of LinkedIn’s Alliance ERG, which is really helping to pour into our Latino community within our LinkedIn doors, but also within the community at large. So I’ve been in that role for a couple of years now, I’m actually stepping away from the co chair role in a couple months and giving an opportunity to newcomers, which is a little bittersweet, but we’ve done incredible work. And I will continue investing in diversity, equity and inclusion in some way, shape or form within the organization. So really excited to be here. So thank you for having me.

AJ Wilcox
Very cool. I announced that you are part of the Latino ERG, we may have listeners who aren’t part of large organizations who may not know about employee resource groups, can you share just a little bit about what these groups are? Why They Matter?

Illiana Acosta
Absolutely. Let’s take a step back as an employee, right? Every single person experiences their tenure, if you will, with an organization in different ways, some more than others, some negatively, some positively. And so when we look at our workplace, we tend to say like, I want to go somewhere where I feel like I belong, or I want to make sure that people understand me, or that I’m seen and heard and valued in a way that I haven’t before. And for that I need to find community. And so at LinkedIn, we have about 10 ERG is employee resource groups that go everywhere from Black, Latino, LGBTQ, plus the Asian community, veterans, etc, etc. There’s so many incredible groups and communities that people can be a part of, as soon as they join the organization feel a complete sense of belonging as soon as they join day one, but also find people that they can relate to and build community with. And it’s also an incredible opportunity for allies, to learn more about different communities and how they can be of support. Because at the end of the day, we spent so much of our time at work and working with individuals and colleagues. And all we want to make sure is that we’re doing really great work for people who appreciate us who see us and understand that our differences are what makes us so unique and great together.

AJ Wilcox
I love that. All right. So switching gears here to your role there at LinkedIn, I would love to hear how you specifically are supporting advertisers, maybe those of us who are listening who may not already be LinkedIn partners.

Illiana Acosta
Yeah, absolutely. So our LinkedIn marketing partners, is a global community of qualified technology and service providers that help our customers, our marketers achieve more on LinkedIn, in simple terms, like on our own work about us, you know, we’re great, but we’re so much greater with our partners. With partners, everything is better, right? So if I can give an example. So today, customers are facing changing buyer behavior, right, for example, shifting to e-commerce, etc. There’s growth in the tech landscape. We’re seeing an increase in spending martech from advertisers. There is now more new and emerging channels, right? Like think about it, the average number of channels to make purchase decisions increased by 2x in the last five years. And so it makes marketers jobs that much more challenging to actually go get to their goals and objectives, right. And so our marketing partners, our LinkedIn marketing partners can help navigate and reduce some of these complexities. And so what my role is, it’s really working with a team of great amazing high performers. And I lead a team that’s working with our enterprise level partners. And those enterprise level partners are typically those partners that are working with our enterprise or global strategic accounts. So those bigger, bigger customers at LinkedIn. However, we have three different teams that support our channel business today. So we have our enterprise partners, which I just explained, are those bigger partners that are working with our biggest accounts, so enterprise and strategic accounts, then we have our skilled partners team that’s led by my colleague, John Hall, who’s total awesomeness in the West Coast. And he’s working with these partners that are typically supporting our online sales or customers or small to mid level size customers. And then we also have our content partners, who are creating these custom content solutions and creative solutions that help enhance a customer’s LinkedIn campaign on the platform. And that’s led by my colleague, Ally Rash, who’s based out in New York. And so we have a whole ecosystem of partners that can help customers address some of the marketing challenges that they have, not only for LinkedIn, but as a whole for their, you know, social media buying as a whole. And so these partners, regardless of their enterprise, or scale, what we classify them internally, they help customers save time, right? So that they have to go through a less of a manual process to set up or manage your campaigns. Like, seriously, can I get an amen for saving time? Amen. Right. I’m like, I love saving time, anything to make me operate more efficient, Sign me up. And so these partners allow marketers to do that. They also allow them to plan more accurately, or target for every stage of the funnel. And so now you can actually sync your marketing strategy, your campaigns optimizations across multiple channels, all within our partner platforms. And so when you’re thinking about activating your ad campaign gains, you want to get the most out of every single dollar you’re investing. And so they also allow for a more in depth understanding of the performance of your campaigns. So you can make better decisions, you can shift dollars, you can shift creatives, you can do things, and optimize on the fly and get so much more value out of your campaigns with LinkedIn, and across our marketing partners.

AJ Wilcox
So we obviously don’t want to call out any specific partners. We don’t want to give anyone a preferred treatment here. Can you tell us about what are some of the kinds of things that you can do through partners, I’m imagining some will help you create campaigns, some will help you optimize and manage some will help you report. What sort of categories am I missing?

Illiana Acosta
Yeah, there’s a few categories. So one, there’s a ton of value in using the partners just because, you know, they allow you to do so much more with us. Over 70% of customers today, with LinkedIn are already using one or more partners. And so everybody’s coming to the party. And so they are tapping into a partner for planning. Right. So insights, helping you developing the right content and creating your campaigns, targeting the right audiences at scale. So planning, we have partners that support campaign execution and tracking. So whether that’s page management or campaign management with LinkedIn, we also have partners that are supportive reporting and ROI. And lead gen, everybody loves a good lead gen campaign. And so there’s so many ways that a partner is supporting customers needs. It just really depends on what are your goals and objectives, right, and let’s start there. And then let’s make sure that as a company, LinkedIn, we’re doing everything possible to tap into our arsenal to address those challenges that you’re having, but also allowing you to get to your goals and objectives. And sometimes that means, like, rockin out just with LinkedIn, right? But sometimes that also means tapping into a partner that can help you really elevate your campaigns and take your campaign further.

AJ Wilcox
I totally agree with that. Alright, so if I could, I would love to pull all of our listeners and ask them who is using a LinkedIn partner for their campaign management or for any part of it? But obviously, since we can’t do that, I hear you correctly, you said 70% of LinkedIn advertisers are using a partner in one way or another?

Illiana Acosta
Yeah, over 70%. They’re using one or more partners. In many cases, customers are using multiple partners for different use cases, right. And so one might be using a partner for reporting. Another one might be doing for lead gen, there’s different use cases, everybody has their special sauce, you know, and so a marketer has the option to work with many partners in order to meet their campaign objectives and more so their marketing goals for the year for the quarter, whatever the case may be. And so yes, so a really good chunk of our customers are already using a partner for their LinkedIn campaigns today.

AJ Wilcox
Oh, yeah. All right. So this leads me to a really good question. How have you seen partners in one way or another elevate your customers LinkedIn campaigns?

Illiana Acosta
We’re on a time constraint, so I can’t even tell you all the stories. You know, again, I’ve been here four and a half years. So I’ve seen you know, across the gamut, small partners, large partners deliver so much value for our customers. And so if I think back to some recent real great wins, so we have metadata metadata, and I know we’re not supposed to calling out but these are success stories, and you can find them on our hub. I’ll give you the site later, but one of our partners metadata helped oyster with their full ABM strategy. And you know, we talked ABM at b2b believe in November, and so therefore, ABM strategy and execution of ad campaigns, I believe it resulted in 3x engagement rate on the campaign, and it’s doubled their ROI in less than 12 months. And so I’m like, what is it that we did that right? It’s like, okay, medicine is one of our enterprise level partners that one of my colleagues, managers, and then we have Zapier, who works with so many of our customers. It’s like Zapier makes you happier, it’s an inside joke on our team. But Zapier is real time. I know, it’s so corny, but it’s fun. They have a real time lead gen solution, and it worked with a customer harnessed.io to look at lead automation, and they were able to improve the accuracy by 99%. From campaign manager to market like huge Wow. And so it’s kind of insane. And there’s there’s other stories of like, you know, teams have reduced their time by six hours per week. And while that might seem a lot take six times 52 weeks, like that’s a lot of hours that you’re saving a customer in managing their campaigns. Helping them operate more efficiently, helping them to do more with less especially now with this economic climate that, you know, we do have less resources, we may have less people. So how do you operate more efficiently when you’re a brand that’s activating 10, 20, 30, 100 campaigns in any given quarter? I would like to think that we’re all super people, super women and men and people, but there’s only so much we can do. So sometimes getting automated tools and tapping into the right tools more than anything, I think can make the biggest difference when you are executing your marketing campaigns with us.

AJ Wilcox
I totally agree with this. We’ve had several episodes in the past that are a partner product spotlight. So if anyone’s ever curious, they can go back and listen to some of those spotlights we put on partners and different tools. But to your point about saving six hours a week, I just think of this as a marketer. Yeah, it’s not a big deal to save six hours. But think about it. This is six, super mundane and monotonous hours that don’t need to be spent, you can now go and spend that doing the really high value stuff, digging deep into the account finding opportunities for scale or decrease costs. So this really is a big deal. Yeah, we shouldn’t be doing the mundane. Exactly. And

Illiana Acosta
Partners make it more accessible. They have scalable tools, it makes your day to day job a lot more simpler and more efficient. And you can spend more time doing the things that really, really require the most attention being more strategic. But you know, when it comes to like copy and pasting things, right, like that, sometimes it’s a really long time, if you’re managing multiple, multiple campaigns. So how can we collectively LinkedIn and our partners help to increase customer value, like, that’s really why I’m even on this team and in this business. I want to help drive value, and I want to help make a difference, and how people are operating every single day. On our own, again, I mentioned, we’re great, you know, we have amazing tools. But sometimes our customers need more access to different tools that our partners provide. And with our partners, they can do things simpler and more efficient, like day parting and auto optimization rules, and add flighting, and management, and creative optimizations and all the things that customers need to enhance their marketing campaigns with us.

AJ Wilcox
Yes, and I can’t tell you how excited I am that there is now this partner ecosystem, because I kind of, quote unquote, grew up in the world of PPC. And there are so many partners out there, if you’re running Google Ads, or Facebook Ads, there’s so many different tools that you can take advantage of. LinkedIn hasn’t had that it hasn’t really been considered a tier one platform until what I would say is fairly recent. And now we have all of those types of things that you’d want to execute that you just mentioned, any of those needs you have, you can go out and find a partner who is doing this on LinkedIn. And I just want to say I think this is super powerful. I’m so proud of where it’s landed.

Illiana Acosta
Yeah, you know, it’s so funny, because like, before I started working here, I was like, B2B. B2B doesn’t have to be boring, B2B can be fun, and really insightful, and really an incredible way to drive some meaningful business outcomes. And so we really have transformed over the last several years, I’d like to think it’s when I joined the company, but I know that’s not accurate. But it really has transformed into this platform that I am so proud to be a part of the growth of our LinkedIn ads business, the growth of the overall organization, what we stand for, and how we’re so we are really doing everything we can to make sure that our customers, our marketers are getting everything that they need from us to be successful. And that is something that I am incredibly proud of.

AJ Wilcox
Oh, I love it. I know there’s a lot to the partner programs, there’s different tiers. Could you tell us a little bit about what maybe benefits are there for partners?

Illiana Acosta
Yeah, so we have different tiers of partners, depending on the tenure with us, but more so depending on the bandwidth and the use cases that you all support, right? Data linked, is a partner of ours, too. Yes, we know you’re an OG, so this is good. Some other benefits include having a one to one relationship with a partner manager, depending on your level of tier. And that is incredible, because you have a trusted resource that you can literally work with every single week to help identify meaningful go to market strategies that are going to help to elevate and drive awareness around our value together as partners, and what we do for our customers together. And so that is powerful, because we have, you know, over 1000 partners in our ecosystem, but not every single partner is managed, and that every single partner is certified they’re all on a journey. And so that’s the journey that’s the path to get partner certified and into the the level of tear that they’re hoping to as they grow with us and they get manager or partner manager on my team or John’s team or Bruno’s team or Lara’s team that I work with but, more so you know there’s opportunity to tap into additional resources that we have to drive go to market together. There’s opportunity to sync directly with our sales teams. There’s opportunity to work directly with our sales leaders to identify leads, prospects, and more. So identify where can we drive the most value for our customers together, there’s opportunity to be a part of our events that we have throughout the year B2Believe, Partner Connect, I heart ABM, there’s so many different touch points that we can include here within, and vice versa, right. There’s also an opportunity for us to show up for your events and be a part of any thought leadership, any webinars, any in person sessions. There’s opportunity to tell stories together, I love telling stories together. Because together, we can really help make a big difference. And so how do we tag team on all efforts to really help again, elevate not so much our companies but elevate the value that we’re offering customers, right, because if together, we continue to build solutions that will help address market challenges and marketers find value in it working with us, it’s just going to be a byproduct of that, right? Like they want to work people that can help solve things for them. And we want to do that with our partners. And so So that’s some of the benefits that you can expect to receive from our partner program. Working with our cross functional teams, we have dedicated resources on the business development side, on the partner end side, we have our B2B Institute, which is our think tank and is fully equipped with incredible thought leaders. We have a full partner marketing team that is ready and able to start on some really cool marketing concepts that again, can help elevate the value that we’re driving for our customers. And so as we evolve this program and continue to grow, there’s so much information that we disseminate through webinars and different methods. And so you can find a lot of that on the hub, which is our LinkedIn marketing partner hub. If you search on Bing, you can directly find that link. And I can also share the links with you, AJ, so you can share out to your followers, your subscribers on here. But yeah, so I think that there’s opportunity for are always on marketing programs, which obviously you get visibility on our hub, which is external facing for all customers and marketers to visit. So that will give you free marketing and visibility for customers to come and learn more about you. That hub also houses our success stories with customers and partners. So that’s another touch point that we can really have there. And then again, as I mentioned before, I think for us, it’s really, really valuable. And we’ve had a lot of feedback from partners, that having that FaceTime with our sales team, either one on one or one to many, whether it be in a larger format or smaller, has been incredibly valuable globally. And so our marketing partners program is not just in North America, but it’s literally across the globe. And many of our partners support our customers across the globe. And some are starting to really branch out into different regions as well, helping to have that global footprint, which is great.

AJ Wilcox
I love this. All right, here’s a quick sponsor break, and then we’ll jump back into the interview.

Illiana Acosta
The LinkedIn Ads Show is proudly brought to you by B2Linked.com, the LinkedIn Ads experts.

AJ Wilcox
Managing LinkedIn Ads is a massive time and money investment. Do you want some of that investment back? Consider booking a discovery call with B2Linked, the original LinkedIn Ads performance agency. We’ve worked with some of the largest accounts over the past 12 years, and our unique scientific approach to ads management, combined with our proprietary tools, allowing us to confidently optimize and scale your LinkedIn Ads faster and more efficiently than any other agency, in-house team, or digital ads hire. Plus, we’re an official LinkedIn partner, which after this episode, you’ll know exactly what that means. Just mosey on over to B2Linked.com/apply. We’d absolutely love the chance to get to work with you.

Alright, let’s go ahead and jump back into the interview.

So I have to ask what qualifies someone to be a marketing partner? I’m imagining because this is with the API. This means these are people who are building tools, right? Who else is able to become a part?

Illiana Acosta
It really just depends on the use cases that you support, right? What’s your special sauce? And whether or not our API’s currently support the use case that you’re looking to really invest in with us. And so you know whether you as a platform can support a campaign management, reporting an ROI. We talked about this before, but audiences, page management insights, lead gen content and creative. So if you fall under any of those use cases that we are API support today, these are all specialties that our current partners do support. If you fall under any of those, you may have a good chance of becoming one of our LinkedIn marketing partners. So there is a developer website that you can visit to apply to become a partner and we will evaluate the use case that you currently support how you’re looking to really plug into our LinkedIn API’s. And if there’s a match, and you fall under any of those specialties, then we can start working together.

AJ Wilcox
Oh, if there is someone out there who’s creating a tool or wants to create a tool, what advice would you give them? What can they do to better help their case to have a higher likelihood of being prioritized or or being taken on as a partner?

Illiana Acosta
I think one be specific in your application, right? As you can imagine, we get a ton of requests, be specific on what’s your special sauce, we want to hear about your special sauce to obviously, if you have customers that are asking for it, that’s always a really great story to share with us. And so many of our customers are working with us, they want to activate their LinkedIn campaigns to our platform. And guess what, hey, we don’t have integration with you. So can we work on that? And so that’s a really great way, right? Because now we have customers asking for this integration to happen. And we can start having those conversations, we can start working with our business development team, with our partner interest team, with our product team and getting all our ducks in a row to make sure that happens. And total sidebar, I said, ducks in a row, and I’m looking out my window. And there’s four ducks walking across the way by the lake. And it’s so funny.

AJ Wilcox
That’s amazing.

Illiana Acosta
Perfect line. Yeah. So I think if they do that, I think that will help build a case, right? Because whatever our customer needs from us, like, we want to make sure that we’re accommodating that. And if one customer is asking for it, the likelihood of many other customers is very high, are also demanding that. Again, we want to work with customers in the way that they want to work with us. And if that’s via a partner, let’s make it happen. And let’s make sure that we are helping to simplify the process and working with LinkedIn as much as possible, ease the transaction between customers, as partners, etc. To make sure that again, we help to simplify the process working with us while also delivering value, and really great outcomes for the marketer.

AJ Wilcox
Awesome Illiana. This has been fantastic. I appreciate you sharing all this information about the partner program. My last question for you is do you have anything exciting that you’re working on professionally, and personally?

Illiana Acosta
Yeah, I’m actually working on a few projects right now. One, I just finished his voiceover workshop not long ago. And I really took the course just to try to do more public speaking because I really enjoy it, it really fills my cup. And then I started realizing, wow, this is a really cool like opportunity to tap into. And it’s been really, really fun just trying to find ways to adjust my voice and work on different projects. So voiceover has been really fun. Also, I have a newsletter called Lost in Translation and sort of tapping into the diversity piece. But the newsletter focuses on highlighting challenges and limitations for historically excluded groups. And it’s a focus on experiences that have shaped who they, I am, and how they and we and me I show up both in my professional life and my personal life, because based on our experiences that really shaped who we are and the way we show up at work. What else am I working on? I’m doing a bunch of speaking engagements around the power of authenticity and taming your inner critic, because you know, impostor syndrome is real.

AJ Wilcox
We’ve all got it.

Illiana Acosta
Oh, my gosh, even on my best days, I’m like, wait, I’m like, no, no, just go to sleep, go to sleep, girl go sleep. But you know, covering topics, you know, the power that we each have. We literally every single person listening on this and not listening, we have the power and influence to create more diverse, more inclusive, and more equitable spaces for every single member of the workforce. And we have more power than we think. And so as you look at your colleague next to you, whether it be in person or on the virtual screen, I talk about how can we show up for others in a meaningful way. And even the smallest action and thought could actually make the biggest difference. And so I’ve been doing a lot around speaking engagements around that, because I think that, you know, the only way that we’re going to change what this world looks like, for future generations is if we start doing the work now. That’s some of the stuff I’m working on.

AJ Wilcox
So true. Is there any way that you want people to be able to reach out to you after this interview? Do you want them to reach out to you on LinkedIn or anywhere else?

Illiana Acosta
Yeah, tap into LinkedIn, honestly, crazy enough, my main social platform and more tech platform that I leverage on a regular basis, not because I work here, but I really enjoy being on the platform. I feel like it feeds me in different ways mentally, spiritually, and educationally and professionally. So LinkedIn, connect with me, send me an InMail happy to dialogue, you know, have some dialogue on there. And yeah, happy to answer any questions as well.

AJ Wilcox
Perfect. So we’ll put a link to your LinkedIn profile down in the show notes as well as the link to the marketing hub. Yes. Ileana, thank you so much for joining us today and sharing of your wisdom. Do you have any parting words for us?

Illiana Acosta
