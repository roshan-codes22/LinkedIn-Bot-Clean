Summary:
If you’re promoting a 
time-sensitive offer
 on LinkedIn—like an event happening in a few days or an expiring promotion—you’ll need to shift away from traditional slow-burn strategies and go into high-urgency mode. The key is to 
maximize reach and speed
, even if it means paying more. To do this, focus on 
larger audiences
, use 
accelerated bidding strategies
 (like CPM or auto bidding), and activate features like the 
LinkedIn Audience Network (LAN)
 to expand impressions beyond LinkedIn itself. You should also stack ad formats—sponsored messaging, sponsored content, dynamic ads—to 
increase visibility
 and catch your audience wherever they are.
Another powerful tactic is to 
leverage urgency and FOMO
 in your ad copy with phrases like “don’t miss it” or “limited seats available,” as long as they’re truthful. If time is very limited, 
duplicate high-performing ads
 instead of creating new ones, to bypass long review delays. Be sure to check if you’re hitting any invisible spending limits on new accounts, and remove them ahead of time. In high-urgency scenarios, efficiency takes a back seat to 
speed and exposure
, so plan to front-load your spend and act fast—it’s easier to slow things down than to scramble to scale up later.
