Episode 1 

​​Hi, Everyone! Welcome to this course. My name is AJ Wilcox. I'm the founder of b2linked.com. We're an ad agency that LinkedIn ads is all we do. I've been doing this stuff ever since 2011. I'm absolutely in love with LinkedIn ads, and I'm also host of the LinkedIn ads show podcast. And since you are taking this course, I'm imagining the subject matter is interesting to you, so you'll definitely want to go subscribe. Go into whatever podcast player you use and search for LinkedIn ads show, you'll see us right there. With that out of the way, this course is a whole walk through of LinkedIn campaign manager. I'm gonna show you all of the settings where to find ads, how to create campaigns, all of that from the ground up. So very first starting out, you'll see I'm here within campaign manager, and I'm looking inside my account at the different campaign groups. Now we'll definitely get into campaign groups in a little while. But very first off, I want to walk you through the navigation, where things are located, how to find them, and what they do. So first off, you'll see plans. And if you hit the down arrow, you can see plan includes both audiences and block lists. I definitely think it's worth walking you through the audiences. So let's go ahead and navigate there. When you see audiences, you should definitely think to yourself matched audiences. Matched audiences are essentially LinkedIn's version of retargeting. Or list targeting as well. You can see when you go to click create audience, it will give you all kinds of options for the types of targeting that you can add here, audiences you can create. So very first off, this one's we've had ever since, I think, 2017, is the ability to upload a list. You can upload either a list of companies for targeting or exclusions, or a list of contacts, people that you want to target or exclude. Then you've got specifically the retargeting. This is everything from anyone who's visited your company page to anyone who's shown interest in a LinkedIn event that you've been running. If they've interacted with a lead generation form in your ads, we'll get to those in a little bit. Any sort of interaction they've done with one of your single image sponsored content ads, those who've watched at least 25% of one of your video ads, as well as website retargeting, those who LinkedIn can recognize have visited your website. You can also create Lookalike Audiences, which on LinkedIn are not all that powerful, but it's at least good to understand that you can do it. I'm really impressed at the pace that LinkedIn has come out with new retargeting features on. So if you see down here in this retarget by, this list is likely gonna keep growing and I hope it does because this is one of my favorite features of the whole platform. The next item in our list here is block lists. Now, block lists are something that can be helpful to you if you are advertising on LinkedIn's audience network. This is generally larger brands that are doing this because it is all about brand control. And the LinkedIn audience network is being able to target people when they're not on LinkedIn. We know we're targeting specific LinkedIn members, but they don't have to be on LinkedIn, they could be on news sites, they could be in apps, we're reaching them outside of LinkedIn. The block lists are all about brand control, where if you're representing a large brand, you can say, here are the categories of websites that we do not want to appear on. It's interesting to note that whether you're using block lists or not, LinkedIn's quality of sites that they've allowed into their audience network is so high that generally this doesn't change your audience size much. But if you need that brand control to know for sure you are not gonna be shown on a low quality site, definitely you can use that there. The next item in our list here is advertise, and I'm gonna take us there. This is the majority of the time that you're going to spend in campaign manager will be here under advertise. I don't know why it's not the first icon. It's a little bit weird, but this is where you're gonna be spending most of your time. The way that LinkedIn's account structure works is you can have accounts which are like the company. One account per company is generally how you do it, although larger companies, larger spenders, may oftentimes have multiple accounts for one company. But for most of the time, I would say that your company needs one ad account. You can put a single credit card on one ad account. So if you have multiple credit cards that you need to use for different spend, then you may have to open a separate account for each one. You do permanently link a company page on LinkedIn to your ads account. So if you have multiple company pages or multiple showcase pages, that might be another reason that you might want more than one account. And when you do go to create a new account, the currency that you select will be permanent. So make sure that you select the right currency right from the beginning and your ad account will live forever like that. What you can see here on the screen is I have four separate campaign groups. Now campaign groups are not something that is going to be very valuable to you, most likely. You can think of it more like a folder, a folder to house or organize all of the different campaigns that you're running. They're a little bit of a lame duck because there's not much that you can do from a campaign group. For instance, if I come here to click create campaign group, you can see the options I have. I can give it a name, I can give it a status, and I can give it a time that it's going to be running. When it hits the end date or end budget, it will likely switch from the status of active to completed or maybe paused. What you can see here from the options is that there aren't many settings that live at the campaign group level. There's no special optimizations or levers that you can pull for performance here. So all this is is just like a folder on your computer where it doesn't do much, it just houses other campaigns. So if I go into the main campaign group that I work out of, I'll just click here on b two linked ads Evergreen. Now you can see a list of the campaigns that I'm running. Campaigns are much more valuable. The campaign itself will dictate which ad format you're using, which objective it's trying to optimize towards. The specific audience that you're targeting, as well as how you're bidding or how you're budgeting, how you're paying for that traffic. We'll certainly spend a lot more time in the campaign settings, but that is really the level in your account that you'll start working from. My recommendation is just to create one campaign group and then create all of your campaigns within it just so you don't have to click up into a different campaign group and then back down to see your performance. You probably want them all in the same area. I'm going to hide our navigation here just to make it a lot easier to see the performance here in the dashboard. Just to help you get familiar with what you're seeing, we have over here the campaign group or groups that were within, because I selected the campaign group that I did, you'll see one selected. And then here on this tab, it's showing the number of campaigns. That I'm looking at. You can also see over here on the furthest right tab that I have 614 total ads. That's because I haven't selected any of the campaigns here, and it's kind of a waterfall effect down. So if I go and select a few of these campaigns, you can see my ad's number has decreased. And this works like a filter because if I wanna go see those twenty eight ads, I can click here directly to ads and go down to the ads level, and now I'm seeing all of the ads that we're running in those three campaigns. To get back up, I'll just come click back on campaigns, and I can deselect those, or I'll just do it en masse. Now I'm back to looking at everything. I wanna call your attention to, first of all, these three buttons up here because you will want to know about them. The first is performance chart. Performance chart is actually awesome. It's the one thing that LinkedIn ads did better than Facebook from the very beginning. If I select a campaign or two here, and then click on performance chart. I now get to visualize the data from these campaigns. And you can do the same thing with ads even as well. If I come over here to display, clicks doesn't tell me much. It just tells me how many clicks I've gotten from those two campaigns combined. But if I click on this, I can see all of the other options for how I can analyze this traffic. Some of my favorite are I wanna look at average cost per click or average click through rate. I can find that if my average click through rate is declining over time. That oftentimes means that my ads are saturating that audience, people are getting sick of it. So I like to track that over time. It may also be helpful to track your total spent. This could be good for budgeting reasons. Tracking your average cost per lead can be cool as well. So check out all of the different options there. This is a great way to analyze your traffic very quickly. It's also interesting that you can disaggregate these because I'm looking at two campaigns, but if I want to see how those two campaigns perform up against each other, I can disaggregate, and now I'm looking at each of those campaigns totally separately. And LinkedIn's pop up here is really helpful, I can see on any individual day how each campaign performed. If I switch this to, let's say, cost per click, I can see that one of these campaigns traditionally costs more than the other. Okay. That's a fun one to go and explore, so definitely spend some time in there. But let's go back here. The next thing I wanna show you is demographics. So these are ad demographics. That means this is the business profile breakdown of those who are actually interacting with your ads. So you can come here to display. This is how you can choose what category of demographics that you want to break down your audience by. So right now, we're looking at job function. And because we're an ad agency, it makes sense that the majority of those in the job function of marketing are the ones who are talking to us and interacting with our ads. You can also see that there's a little bit of business development, which can also be CEOs, And then media and communication is the next one that is also kind of couched in with marketing a lot of times. But if I'm interested in job title, for instance, I can break it down by that and see, oh, marketing managers, product marketing manager, marketing director are some of my top interactors. At least receiving the majority of the impressions. You can break down by company name, company size, industry, seniority, all of those types of things. I really like looking at seniority. You can see that the majority of the time it's directors who are getting the majority of the impressions. And then the last button I wanna show you is export. This is super super valuable because you can export your LinkedIn ads data out to a spreadsheet. Use Excel, And as you do this, you get a lot of different options. Lincoln has really beefed this up over the last several years to where now we get access to a lot of different reports. If you export your ad performance, every single ad gets its own row. So if I show you this, this is like, the majority of of what I'm gonna run as a report? I'm gonna choose add performance because it has pretty much everything in the account. And then when I come to time breakdown, if I choose broken out by day, each ad is going to have its own row every single day that it it ran. So if I have ten ads in my account and I'm looking at ten days, I'm gonna have a hundred rows of data. If you're gonna do any sort of analysis over time, like a trending analysis, you're probably going to want to grab this by day and then use a pivot table in cell to visualize the and track the changes over time. If you're not interested in daily or weekly, you can go to broken out by month. This might be good for looking at your monthly performance for the whole year or for the last couple years. You can see if your ad performance is generally improving over time or waning. For this one, you would have a row in your spreadsheet for every single ad for every single month that it ran. If you're not interested in how things are trending over time, you'll wanna select this ad performance for all time. What this does is even if I select for a whole year, if I only had ten ads running during that time, I'm only gonna have ten rows of data in my spreadsheet. If you don't care about ads, you just want to know about your different campaigns, you can choose a campaign report here, campaign performance. Those two are the majority of the reports that I use. So we're looking at the campaign performance here. And what I want to bring your attention to here is where it says columns. By default, your column will probably be performance. And I like that performance is the default because performance is a really good general purpose way of looking at your stats. It has the majority of the important stuff here. You can see how much you've spent. You can see how many clicks and impressions your ads drove and what the click through rate was. You can also see your cost per click. So right there, I'm immediately seeing a lot of the elements that I'm already looking for. As you scroll over, you'll see things about conversions leads, events registrations, and that's pretty much it. So this is a great place to stay. I would not focus on conversions here in this column. The next option we have though is delivery. Now delivery is going to be helpful for if you're looking specifically at your reach and frequency reporting within your account. If you're looking for your reach and frequency, you obviously know what you're doing, so you'll know why you're going there. If you don't understand, you probably don't need it. Next, you have engagement. Engagement is all about a detailed breakdown of how people are engaging with your ads. So you'll get to see what are they clicking on? Are they clicking on your company page? Are they following your company? Are they commenting? Are they liking or reacting to your ads? Any way that someone is going to interact with your ad, you'll be able to see from engagement. Next, conversions and leads, conversions and leads is really helpful if you actually are tracking anything to do with conversions, because it's going to break down all of the different types of conversions. Now, conversions and leads is exactly what you're gonna wanna use if you are looking at conversion specific metrics. It makes sense, but here's why. So it'll obviously show you the basic stuff, like your spend, your clicks, your impressions, but what it shows you now is that conversions are actually broken up into three different columns. LinkedIn is going to report your conversions, but they're not going to tell you that this number, like eight in this case, it includes both your click conversions and your view conversions. Click conversions I really like. This is actually how I base all of my reporting, These are the conversions that happen after someone sees my ad, clicks on it, and then converts on my ad within the conversion window. But a view conversion is someone who made it to my conversion event, but they didn't click my ad. That means the ad appeared on their screen at some point within the conversion window, but that's it. And so if you are doing reporting for your company, or your client, and you're reporting that there were eight conversions that happened within this time period, but two of those actually occurred on a different channel. Maybe they came in from Google ads, maybe Facebook, retargeting, whatever you're running, you definitely want to report on the number that's most accurate to the channel. That is if that's what you're looking to do. As you scroll over here, you'll see things like your leads, your lead form opens, and your lead form completion rate. These are if you are using the lead generation objective, that is the native lead generation forms within ads, which we'll talk about here a little bit later. And as you scroll over, you'll see all the other options, so feel free to have a look at those. Next, we've got sponsored messaging. Now, sponsored messaging is the one that you'll want to use if you are using any of the sponsored messaging ad formats. The reason why you actually want to use this column setting when you're using the sponsored messaging ad formats is this. If you are just on performance and you're looking at a sponsored messaging ad, it will calculate your cost per click and your click through rate as your cost per open and your open rate. And so I've had so many people come to me and say, Hey, AJ, I am running sponsored messaging and my cost per click is less than a dollar. Or my click through rate is fifty five percent. Obviously, people really like what I'm putting out there. But then as they track it, they'll go, but my cost per conversion is in the hundreds of dollars. The reason why they're being misled is because they're still in the performance columns. And it's showing them that their cost per open is actually less than a dollar and their open rate is fifty five percent. That's a lot more in line. And a click is definitely the next step of the funnel, and it requires a lot more intent. If you're here within sponsored messaging, it will actually show you your sponsored messaging clicks and your cost per sponsored messaging click. This is a great one to be aware of. Next, we have video. If you are running video ads, you'll see how many people viewed, which means they watched the video or it was on their screen for at least two seconds. The view rate, which is of all the people who the ad appeared for how many watched for as at least two seconds. How many watched for at least twenty five percent of the duration, how many made it to fifty percent, how many made it to seventy five percent, and then how many completed it. This is obviously great if you're running video ads. Next on the list, we have budget and bid. This is an in-depth view of the different budgets and bids, and bid types of each of the campaigns that you're looking at. It'll show you really interesting things like your average daily spend, here's your bid, how you're bidding, what you're bid is if it's manual or automated. Next on the list, we have talent leads and job applicants. Now if you are using LinkedIn recruiter, you may actually be using these, but because the majority of what we do is with marketing departments and not necessarily with recruiting licenses, we don't use those much. Then what you have is the ability to customize your own columns. So I created a custom view here called budget check. And this is gonna give me all of the different views and all the different columns that I want when I'm going through to do a budget check of an account. But you can customize your own column setup and put just the metrics in there that you care about. Your time range will obviously be really important to you as well. This will allow you to choose the time range that you're analyzing. If I wanna look at just the last month, I can click one of these presets, or I can select on the calendar, the start date in this pin and the end date in this one. You can see here under filters. This is where you get to say, hey, if I have a hundred and sixty two campaigns going on here, I only want to look at specific ones. I can filter down to only certain statuses I can look at only certain ad types, or I can filter just by the objective I care about. For right now, I'll just hit reset. So nothing is being filtered out of my view. The last option here is for breakdown. Break down, you can break down your performance by the type of conversion. So let's say that you have three or four different conversions in your account, you can see which conversions are actually being fired by which campaigns and which ads. You can also see your breakdown if you are using the LinkedIn audience network, how much of your traffic is coming from on network, meaning on LinkedIn, or how much is coming off, meaning one of LinkedIn's partner sites. If you're running carousel ads, which we'll talk about here in a little bit, you can also break down your performance by which tile in your carousel is performing the best. Okay. Let's come back here to the navigation, and we'll finish going through all the different options you have in your account. The next is test. Now a test is actually a brand lift study that you can run. LinkedIn has offered this for years if you're working directly with your account rep. But they realized that if they could bake it right into the platform, it would be a lot more accessible. So the way it works is you can create a test. And you're eligible to run one of these tests as long as you're spending at least ninety thousand dollars per quarter. So this is definitely for the larger advertisers, it's not great for smaller accounts. But if you do qualify, you can come and create a new test and it will show ads like this to people that you've been targeting with your ad. So it'll start out by showing people who probably haven't seen your ads very much and it'll ask them questions about your brand in order to set a benchmark like how many people know about this company? And then as you advertise over the quarter, it's gonna keep showing these ads to people who've been in your advertising audience, and it'll actually show you your lift. How many more people are aware of and interested in your brand than were before you started advertising. So this can be a great way of telling you how effective your advertising is at driving word-of-mouth. Okay. Let's go back here. Next, we have analyze. Underneath analyze, we have your insight tag, which is super important to install on your website. So if you haven't already installed your Insight tag, make sure you come here. This only needs to be done once. You generate this tag and then you put it in the code of every single web page on your website. This is going to enable things like conversion tracking, like website retargeting, as well as the free website demographics tool that I'll show you here in another moment. So if you're able, this is definitely something I would do. Next, you have website demographics. Now website demographics is really cool, and it is very much under utilized. What this is is if you've had your insight tag on your website, LinkedIn is watching for anyone who comes to your website that LinkedIn recognizes, meaning they have the LinkedIn cookie in their browser, and LinkedIn knows who they are, it'll look up who that person is, by their seniority, by what company they work at, by what job title they have, etcetera. And then it's going to show you, as soon as you get at least three hundred people that LinkedIn has identified, it will show you this breakdown of how those people are interacting with your website. Now you'll remember that I showed you your demographics within ads and that means it's only looking at the demographics of the people who are interacting with your ads. But this is different. This is like Google Analytics or Facebook Analytics for your website, it's analyzing all the traffic, not just the traffic that you're paying for. It has much of the same breakdowns as you do on the other tools, so you can look at job function, job title, seniority, company size, country, county, etcetera. Now, this is totally free. You don't have to spend a dime on LinkedIn ads in order to get this reporting. It's just like Google Analytics and Facebook Analytics, where it's detailed analytics about what's happening on your website, and it's free. Next, we have conversion tracking. When you come to conversion tracking, you get to specify the pages on your website. We call these thank you pages, where if someone reaches it, you know that means that they just filled out a form or converted in some way. That's my preferred way to create conversions. But there's also an event based conversion where you can get your website developer involved, and they can affix code to a specific button. Where someone clicks on a button or a specific element on the website loads, then you can count them as a conversion. You can see here if there's a green dot, that means that traffic is actively hitting that that LinkedIn can see. If there's a red dot, it could mean that there's a problem because LinkedIn hasn't seen a signal in a while. Okay. Next, as we come down here to assets. You have lead generation forms where if you are using LinkedIn's lead generation objective, This is where you get to manage the forms that you're attaching to your ads and getting people to fill out. As this is a test account, you won't see a whole lot going on here, but you can certainly imagine in yours if you were using the LinkedIn lead gen forms, you'd see numbers here underneath leads and test leads. And if you did see leads, you could actually come in here to click on it and then hit download leads. This is how you could get that personal information from people who filled out forms and download it right into Excel. Next, you have Landing Pages, and this is one that you only get if you are using LinkedIn recruiter. So if you're in that camp, you'll see options there. But because this one isn't attached to a LinkedIn recruiter license, we won't see this option here. Next, we have asset history. Now, assets are shared audience that you've built inside of one account and you want to share with another account. So let's say that your company has three different ad accounts for it. Maybe that's run by three different departments. One of those departments could have set up LinkedIn retargeting, website retargeting, and then they can then share that audience with the other two ad accounts, who, from within those, they can now set up a retargeting campaign and they can all utilize the same audiences. So this is great if you're sharing between accounts. Next, within account settings, you have manage access. This is how if you were going to give access to your account to someone else, let's say you just hired a new employee or you hired an ad agency to help you, you'll click on this and go and add that person's LinkedIn profile to your access list. You can choose what level of access they get if it's read only if it's full admin, if it's just campaign manager and they can make edits here and there. Billing Center is exactly what it sounds like. This is where you can go in and set the credit card that your account is spending on, as well as check all invoices and charges that have occurred up to that point. When you come to edit account, these are the settings that are at the account level. So this is where you choose the name of the account. Like I said, currency is already set. So as soon as you create the account, you choose this, and now I can't edit it from here on out. This is also the LinkedIn page that my account is associated with. I can't disassociate that either. The last two options that we have here are a link to the company page, so I could click this and go to see my company page. You'll also see the link to business manager. Now, this is something new that LinkedIn's come out with. It is mimicking what we've already experienced with Facebook ads. They have a business manager where instead of adding employees one by one to an account, you can just give a business manager access to an employee and then they can then access all of the accounts and manage them within that business manager. I won't go into this today, but just understand that really similar to Facebook's business manager, as well as like Google Ads, MCC, or multiclient Center. Okay. Now that we've been through all the options, let's actually go into the general campaign structure, as well as the ads, because this is where you're gonna spend the majority of your time. Like I said before, I'm gonna go directly into the the campaign group that I work mostly out of, and I'll close our navigation here just to give us a little bit more room. All of the stats that we're seeing here are all associated with the entity that we're looking at. So we're in a campaigns view right now, which tells me these are the performance of all of the ads that are happening within that campaign. If I were to select ads over here instead, it would show me my performance for each individual ad. You can see this is a little bit disorganized, and so to get it all organized, I like to come in here and sort by spend. So now I'm looking at the campaigns that are ordered by how many have spent the most. There are two options that I have with one of these campaigns. I could either click on it directly, or I can click on the three dots, and hit edit. I'll show you both separately. I'll open these in new tab so we don't lose our place. So if I click on just the name of the campaign here, that's going to drill into that one campaign, and we're gonna look at all of the ads that have run within that campaign in the time frame that we're looking at. This is a great way to assess your performance, look and see which ads are making the biggest difference. If I come back here though and instead of clicking on the name of the campaign, If I click on the three dots and hit edit, again, I'll open this in a new tab, and this is letting us change the campaign. This is looking at the settings. So we can see what the objective of the ad is. We can see the name of the campaign. And we can see the targeting, who it's going after. You can see this campaign is specifically targeting the more senior seniorities, of those people who have visited our website. That's kinda cool. You can also see the ad format that's being used. And if we select placements here, you can see there is an option for me to show on the LinkedIn audience network, or we can just keep all of the traffic just on LinkedIn. And then the last section here is all about your bidding and your budgeting, how you're paying for the traffic. So I like to set a daily budget, and then just keep these going evergreen for a while. And then if I ever don't wanna be running this campaign, I can just pause it, and then it won't run anymore after that. You also have the options of setting a lifetime budget, so once it spends its budget, it just turns off, and you can also set a daily and a lifetime budget. But just the daily budget is my preferred method. You can also see down here in the bidding section, before I forget, I wanna take us back to an option called enable audience expansion. The audience expansion is a terrible option. LinkedIn will have auto selected this every time you create a new campaign, audience expansion will be enabled. That's the first thing you'll want to do is make sure you've disabled this because it's absolute garbage. We are already paying a significant premium to be advertising on LinkedIn. We do not need LinkedIn adding people who are not qualified to our audience. It's a black box, it just muddies the waters of our targeting, and I won't mince words when I tell you don't use this. It's just it's never worth it. Okay. Back here to the bidding. By default, LinkedIn is going to turn on maximum delivery. And what maximum delivery is, is a really high bidding version of paying for the impression. My preferred method for paying for traffic is to go down to show additional options, and use manual bidding. This allows me to change how much I'm willing to pay per click. This is the cheapest way to pay for LinkedIn traffic about ninety percent of the time. And you can see here LinkedIn gives me this range that for this audience, that most people would be paying ten sixty two to nineteen dollars per click, I can come in here and set it to something really low, like two dollars, and then LinkedIn will show me what the actual floor bid is for that. So I'm not able to run the campaign bidding less than five dollars and ten cents. Okay. And the last step here within the campaign is conversion tracking. So if you are driving conversions from your website and you have your insight tag installed on every page of your website, you can then associate these conversions with your campaigns. So inside of this campaign, we have associated these four different types of conversions. This is obviously something great to set up. Now, these are all the settings that you might find within your campaign. The next step is the ads that are within that campaign. So if I click next, I can go here and see all of the different ads that I have within this campaign, and it'll tell me whether they're on or off. You can also create ads directly from here, or you can browse existing ads or even posts on your company page that you could then boost and turn into ads. Now, I don't wanna save any of the changes that I made, so I'm just gonna back out of here. But I'm gonna go to one of these campaigns that's spent the most here, I'm going to click on it, and now since I'm looking at just the performance of the ads, I can come here to click on the three dots and hit edit. This takes us to the same settings we were looking at before, but this one takes us right to the ad settings, not the audience targeting and all the campaign settings we were looking at before. The one option you should know about here is if you come and click on this cog, you'll see this option of add rotation. I highly recommend, just like LinkedIn does, to leave it here on optimized for performance. The other option is to rotate ads evenly, which Sounds really good, but I like to call this the charge me more and show me less button. When you use this, what ends up happening is it doesn't show your ads evenly to your audience, it enters them into the auction evenly. So this is my recommendation for any sort of ad type except for sponsored messaging. For sponsored messaging, rotating evenly is great because that's how you get a real AB test with sending out your messaging ads. Okay. So if we come out of the settings here, let's just go through and do a dummy ad. Let's create a campaign from scratch, as well as an ad from scratch. So you can see the whole process all the way through. So if I click create, I can choose a new account, a campaign group, or a campaign. Like I said before, I like to keep everything within the same campaign group. So I'll just click create campaign. The first thing that it asks me here is which campaign group do I want it to be underneath. I'm gonna click use a different group just because this is the one that I run most of my everything through. Then I'll hit next, and the next option that LinkedIn gives us is our objective. Now, you do wanna be thoughtful about the objective that you select, Because once you've activated a campaign and set it live, you can't change the objective. It is solid, it's glued in there. The two that I highly suggest would be use website visits if you're driving traffic to your website. And use lead generation if you want to use LinkedIn's lead gen forms. Those are my two basics. I'll also play with engagement because the cost of the floor is a little bit lower than website visits, but you also pay for every engagement Whereas a website visits campaign, you're only gonna pay when someone clicks on the landing page to go to wherever you're you're calling them to action towards. Video views is how you do video, and website conversions is really similar to website visits, But with this one, LinkedIn is specifically trying to target those who would be most likely to convert. I haven't found LinkedIn's AI to be all that great at that, you really need to get a lot of conversions happening. LinkedIn like Facebook recommends at least fifty conversions per week per campaign And there aren't that many LinkedIn advertisers who are running that kind of volume, but certainly, it may be worth giving a shot, testing it out, if you want. For the purposes of this dummy campaign, I'm just gonna go with website visits. Now I get to go start selecting the audience I wanna go after. So if I were trying to reach someone like myself, I can come here and change my location, but I'll go with the United States. That's fine for this example. The two options that we have for your target, I don't know why audiences is the first one, the default because this is where you're retargeting and you're list uploads live. The majority of the targeting that we do on LinkedIn is using their native audiences. So I'm gonna come down here to click audience attributes, And this is where I get to start targeting people by their job experience and their company. For this example, I'm gonna target anyone in marketing So I'll come here to job experience and job functions, and I can either type marketing or scroll down. Since there's only twenty six of these, it's just as easy to scroll down, but I'll show you, I hit marketing. So that narrowed my audience from a hundred ninety million down to three point one million. Which is pretty cool. If I want to keep narrowing that though, because I really like audience sizes that are between twenty thousand to eighty thousand, I'm gonna come here to narrow audience further, and then LinkedIn's gonna give me the same choice again. I'll come to audience attributes, more job experience, and I'm going to select their seniorities. These are all marketers, but I'm only gonna want marketers who are decision makers. So I'm gonna go with manager and everything above. That took me down to one point one million, which is good. We're down to about a third. But I do want to filter a little bit further. So I'll come here to narrow, and I'll do the process again. I'm interested in companies that are large enough to be able to afford my product or service. And if I have a high value product or service, that usually means that my company sizes going to be larger. So if I come here to company, I can go to company size, And I can select those companies that have, let's say, at least two hundred employees and go all the way up. Alright. Now we're at five hundred and twenty thousand, which is we're getting a lot better, but this is still a very large audience. LinkedIn loves to see large audiences because if you have a large audience, it means you're probably going to be able to spend your budget. I'm a lot less interested in spending my full budget. I'm a lot more interested in spending it effectively. I wanna get this audio size down a little bit further. I'll come here to narrow, and this might be a good time to narrow down by industry. So if I come to company industry So let's say, let's look at those who are in the tech sector. So if I come here to technology information and media, I can get media and telecom, as well as information and internet. That takes me down to a hundred and twenty thousand, which is pretty close. If I try to cut this anymore, I might end up in an audience that's too small, but I could always come up here to my options and say, hey, maybe I don't want managers, maybe I just want directors and above, then I get down into that sixty nine thousand, which is great, it's right within my favorite audience size. I mentioned before that you'll always want to uncheck enable audience expansion as the first thing I come to do. Next, I get to choose my ad format. Now, I love the single image ad. This is like my default. It's my first thing I try, It shows up in the news feed and it's really simple to build because it's just an image with text up above and text down below. But you can also choose a carousel ad, which is the same thing, but instead of just having one image, it has multiple tiles that you can scroll through on mobile, or arrow through on desktop. You can do video ad. This is where, obviously, you play a video. You have text ads that show up only on the right rail of LinkedIn, and that's There's only a right rail on desktop. So this is all desktop traffic, and I like text ads because they are the cheapest ad format on LinkedIn. You can pay all the way down to two dollars per click, and they tend to do really, really good with brand support, propping up any other ad format that you're running, if people are seeing your ads constantly, your brand over in the right rail, they're gonna be more likely to interact with them and click on them when they see them in the news feed. The spotlight ad is this is what LinkedIn calls a dynamic ad. With a dynamic ad, your brand gets the full three hundred by two fifty block of ad inventory, whereas with text ads, you're gonna end up sharing that with usually one to two other advertisers. Then you have message ads and conversation ads. Message ad is going to be one where you send a message, like an email or an inmail, directly to someone's LinkedIn messaging box or your inbox. Conversation ad works very much the same way, it's just, it's interactive. You can do this choose your own adventure where you get to ask certain questions and if they say yes or no or pick one of your options, you then ask them further questions, and walk them down a decision tree. Then you have event ads, and this is how you can drive traffic to a LinkedIn event that you want to promote. As we scroll down, you'll see placements here, you'll see that LinkedIn's audience network is already checked. On the page, and that's okay with me. The LinkedIn audience network is full of sites that are really high quality, and so I don't have a problem with my ads showing up there. That being said, it's different from Facebook and Google, because if you're a big advertiser on Facebook or Google, you'll likely know that the audience network on Facebook is to be avoided. And Google's display network is also generally regarded as very low quality. This might be a little bit different than from what you're used to, but I like that option. Next, like we talked about before, you can come in and set your daily budget, I'll use this hundred dollar daily budget. I'll say run continuously from today. And like I mentioned before, wanna come in here and choose manual bidding just because that's the cheapest way to pay the majority of the time. You will notice that this range is a little bit ridiculous. It probably hard to see here on the screen, but LinkedIn is recommending that I bid twenty three to fifty nine dollars per click. That is garbage. If my ads are performing decently at all, I shouldn't have to pay anywhere near that. So I'm gonna come in here and bid significantly lower. Maybe I start with eight dollars or maybe even closer to the floor, because the worst thing that can happen if I've bid too low is I just don't get impressions or traffic. And I can always come in tomorrow and incrementally increase those bids over and over. Then we have the conversion tracking, and it actually already pulled in some conversions, I'll just click all because it's no problem if it's tracking more conversions than are actually represented within that campaign, so I don't mind if they're all there. Now, before I hit next, I like to name my campaign. So you can see this pencil up here for edit. I'll just use my own campaign naming structure here, but, of course, you can name whatever you'd like. I know that this is a single image ad, which we used to call sponsored content, so I'm gonna start with that and a separator, and then I like to use the objective. This one's the website visits objective. So I'll do w v and then another separator. And now I like to describe who the audience is. So as I scroll down here, I know I'm targeting the marketing job function, so I can do marketing, JFK, I'm also doing seniorities of director and above, so I can do DIR plus, that shows me that I'm targeting the marketing job function with the seniority of director and above. And I'll write. Synuity there? Another separator, and I can do company size. So this is two hundred plus company size. In the tech industry in the US. Now, if I come down here to next, I can then fill this campaign with ads. And you can see it wants me to confirm, once I hit save, this campaign is in stone. We can't change the objective or the ad format it is created. Which I'm okay with. So I'll create a new ad here, and I like to name my ads so that they are individually trackable. So if I put today's date, as well as an a, that tells me if I'm running an AB test, this is version a, and I could go and create another version b. This is a great basic way to track your ads. You can go a lot more specific, a lot more in-depth. But this might be a good way if you are just starting out basic on your LinkedIn ads. Next, you can come in here and type your intro text. This is the text that shows up up above your ad, and this is the most important part of the ad from my experience. There are two things I like to put in here. I like to put in here why you should pay attention. This is our attention grabber, and also a strong call to action. This is where we get to ask them and tell them what we want them to do. Then you can come down here to your destination URL. This is where you're gonna be sending your traffic, I'm just gonna type in my website. And then if I hit scrape, LinkedIn's going to go in and grab an image from the web page that it scraped, as well as the headline, which they actually grabbed the title tag, the SEO title tag from the page, as well as the description, which is the meta description. For the headline, I like to describe the kind of content that someone's getting, so I might put something like free checklist, and then I like to use the name of the asset. So it might be something like your free twelve step, LinkedIn, ads, checklists. It obviously tried to grab an image, but it did not. So I'm gonna use my own image here, and I will tell you that this description box this used to be used back in like twenty sixteen, but it has not been used since. So whether you just leave what's in there or whether you clear it out blank, it doesn't matter. No one's gonna see that. Just for an example here, I'll upload an image. And I'll select this one because I like orange because it contrasts so well against blue. I can then come and choose my call to action, and let's say it's download because I'm maybe downloading this checklist. And if I hit add to campaign, it will automatically add this to the campaign I'm creating. So you can see, it says campaign in draft, so it doesn't matter what status the ad is in, the campaign's in draft, so it's not eligible to run. So if I hit next, it's gonna show me all of my settings and I can just hit launch. And then, of course, it tells me I did a good job. If I go to account overview, now I can see that campaign, whether it's running or not, and I can also see what status the ads are in. It can be tricky to find things within your dashboard if you have a lot of of campaigns. So I know that the campaign I just created had marketing job function in it. So I'll just do a quick search, and look at that, I found it. Since this is not actually a campaign I want running, I can always click here to pause it. Then once I clear this, I'm back looking at all of the different campaigns in my account. So I hope this has been ultra helpful for you.
