Summary
‍
Thinking about running LinkedIn Ads? AJ Wilcox, founder of B2Linked.com, shares key insights after managing over $120M in ad spend. First, know that 
LinkedIn Ads are premium-priced
—$8–$11 per click—so they work best for 
high-ticket B2B offers
, not ecommerce or affiliate marketing. Unlike search engines, LinkedIn is better for 
top- and mid-funnel engagement
, making it ideal for nurturing, not quick sales.
To succeed, you need 
low-friction offers
 like webinars, checklists, or whitepapers, and a 
minimum budget of $3–5K/month
 to gather meaningful data. The real strength lies in LinkedIn’s 
hyper-targeting abilities
, letting you filter by job title, seniority, company size, or matched audiences. To get started, AJ suggests setting up your Company Page, installing the Insight Tag, and launching with static image ads. For a full checklist, visit
