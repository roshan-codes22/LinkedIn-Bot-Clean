Episode 3 

Hi, everyone! I'm AJ Wilcox. I'm the founder of b2linked.com and we're the ad agency that LinkedIn adds is all we do. I'm excited to have you here on our third course. This is the advanced LinkedIn tactics and strategies course, where we'll get to talk about the most advanced ways to keep your targeting tight resulting in the best quality of leads. Also keeping your costs low and your performance high. Without further ado, let's go ahead and jump in. For those of you who've taken the basic and the walk through courses, This won't be any surprise to you, but my name's AJ. I live in the state of Utah in the United States. I've been doing digital marketing for about the past 15 years and I stumbled onto LinkedIn ads about 11 years ago. Absolutely fell in love with them. They became the very best leads that my sales teams wanted to work with and so I eventually just went all in. I love anything that requires physical endurance. I also love anything that goes fast. Fast cars, motorcycles, off roading, all that kind of stuff. You'll see that a lot of the themes in this course revolve around how to mitigate the risk of LinkedIn. First of all, we know that LinkedIn ads are inherently a risky ad channel because the costs are high, and the traffic acts more like maybe even a top to middle of funnel kind of traffic unless you're using retargeting. Because of those two big risks, we can mitigate those by doing a couple things. First of all, by trying to do our best to control costs to keep costs low. And also avoid LinkedIn's best practices, quote unquote, because LinkedIn's recommendations are usually not in your best interest. We'll talk about things like disabling audience expansion or don't use LinkedIn's auto bidding, at least right upfront. The challenges that we face with LinkedIn are first of all, the costs are really high compared to a lot of channels. We pay on average $8-$14 per click. This of course could be higher if you're in North America targeting really competitive audiences. Or it can be much lower if you're in other areas of the world, especially in other languages. But that's kind of the average of what we see here in North America. We also know that the platform won't let us bid by device, which means all of our ads that we create, we essentially have to plan for them being seen mostly by mobile and a little bit by desktop. The platform hasn't given us the ability to do day parting or add scheduling, which would actually be a really, really good thing because of traffic patterns the way that people move around in a professional way on the professional network, but LinkedIn hasn't given it to us, so we actually have to do that ourselves. And then finally, LinkedIn has a relevancy score. Very similar to that of Google that has a quality score or Facebook that has a relevance score. LinkedIn's got it too. They call it relevancy score, but you can't actually see it anywhere. If you run a campaign report, you can see what LinkedIn calls a campaign quality score, but that's a snapshot that's done that does not actually mean relevancy score. They're two very different things. These are a lot of the challenges that we're trying to overcome. Anytime I'm advertising to an audience, I know I have some hurdles ahead of me that I have to make it over. So the first thing I have to do is get people to click on my ads once I've shown them. And then the next thing is once they've clicked, I need to get them to convert. Or take the action that I want them to. When you're judging how your first hurdle is going, the metric that you want to watch is your click through rate percentage. It's essentially telling you of everyone who I've shown the ad to how many people took action. And I'll show you the benchmark slide here in a little bit, but as you compare and find out how you're doing compared to average, that can tell you if you're doing a great job, your ads are really engaging making people want to click. Or their average or below average, and, you know, you can do some work on the ads to get the click through rates up. The next one is getting people to convert. And the metric that we want to watch for this is your conversion rate percentage. Of everyone who has clicked on my ads how many ended up taking the desired action. So figure out where it is that your performance is actually struggling, is it over that first hurdle getting people to click, so you want to develop your ad copy and offers better? Or is it on the back end with getting someone to actually take action? That could deal with things like how much value are you promising the offer. How friction prone is that experience to convert, etcetera. Could be your landing page, could be the form, anything that really helps people convert. So here's the benchmark slide I was telling you about. If you're running sponsored content on LinkedIn, you can expect your click through rate to be about an average of point four four percent. It's a little bit less than a half of a percent. So if you're doing significantly better than this, great. If you're around it or below, you probably need to tune something up. Expect your costs per click to be anywhere in that eight to fourteen dollar range, but hopefully lower if you can find lesser competition elsewhere. Your conversion rates are going to vary wildly based off of what you're offering, how much value it is, like at least the perceived value that the prospect sees, as compared to the friction that you're providing them. So if you're offering something that I would consider middle of the road kind of friction, oftentimes these these are gated assets. I want you to fill out a form and give me your information. And in exchange, I'll give you something of value. You can expect conversion rates in the ten percent to fifteen percent range. But what if you're going after more of high friction kind of approach like buy something now or talk to my sales rep or get a free trial of a product. All of these types of things are high in friction, and you can usually expect one and a half to four percent conversion rates. Just again, based off of the value. Then we move into text ads. Text ads are over in the right rail, like we talked about in in the basic training. They don't get clicked on very much. And so, if you have a click through rate that's over about point zero to five percent, you're doing great. Keep it up. Expect your costs per click to be anywhere in that three to six dollar range, and conversion rate is definitely totally dependent on the offer. The amount of value you're offering versus the amount of friction that they have to go through. There's also sponsored messaging on the platform. This one you can expect open rates when you send one of these to be about fifty five percent, and then a click through rate of an average of about three point two percent. Once someone has opened, then they go on to click. That means that when you actually look at a cost per click, not the cost per click that LinkedIn reports in campaign manager, but when you're actually looking at your the costs that you've paid versus the number of clicks that someone took on your messages, on your offers, you're gonna be somewhere in that twenty three to fifty eight dollar range. Ideally below because that's obviously very expensive. Okay. Let's talk about bidding strategies on LinkedIn. And I know this graph looks like something from your econ classes, but follow my logic here. What we have here is your costs from low to high versus your click through rates from low to high. So that's what we're looking at basically, how much are you going to pay based off of what your click through rate is. This line right here that represents your CPC bid, This is your effective cost per click when you are bidding by cost per click. This one right here is your effective cost per click. When you are bidding by cost per impression. And right where they meet, this is the break even point where it essentially doesn't matter whether you're bidding by click, or whether you're bidding by impression, you're gonna be paying about the same either way. So I wanna call your attention here to this vertical line. Which is at the .4% click through rate. This, if you'll remember from our benchmark slide, this is the average click through rate of sponsored content. If you're looking at just the average, you'll see that anyone who is paying by the impression is paying significantly more than those who are paying by the click. So what if you had a 2% click through rate, which happens occasionally? Then if you were bidding by the click, you would be paying significantly more than if you were paying by the impression. So what this tells us is that if we don't have prior data, to how a campaign or how an ad's going to perform, my recommendation is highly to bid by cost per click to start out with. And not only that, LinkedIn is going to make recommendations to you that make you bid really high when you bid manually, but you want to start out by bidding significantly lower. Than what they recommend. And we'll get into that strategy as well. And then it's really only after you've gotten a click through rate that's over about 1%, when I suggest switching to what LinkedIn used to call auto bidding, now they call it maximum delivery. Maximum delivery is really just a high bidding cost per impression bid. You can bid manually by impression, but we find that LinkedIn's maximum delivery is actually really good at that. As long as our click through rates are high. So I'm gonna walk you through the the bidding and budgeting section on LinkedIn when you go to create a campaign. First of all, you'll see that when you get to the bidding section, you've got two options. You have maximum delivery and cost cap bidding. But there is that little line item here that says show additional options. So if we click that, it reveals the third option here, which is manual bidding. And I find it so funny that LinkedIn will hide one row with a button that takes up one row. But we know why they do this Because on that graph I showed you on the page before, we know that LinkedIn makes a lot more money from you. You end up paying LinkedIn more money when you're bidding by the impression. So let's go ahead and click on manual bidding here. So we we choose manual bidding, and you can see LinkedIn puts some giant number in there for what they recommend we spend. They put $17.94. This isn't a crazy example. This is kind of a middle of the road example. We've seen much higher than this. And check this out. LinkedIn is recommending that you spend somewhere between thirteen twenty five to twenty eight seventy four per click. So they've put in this seventeen ninety four as their recommended bid. And so as a new advertiser, I might look at this and say, Whoa, the range is from thirteen twenty five to twenty eight. Does that mean I can't pay any lower than thirteen dollars a click? No, thank goodness. So what you do is you put a dollar or put some low number in that box, and LinkedIn's going to pop up in red letters as soon as you click away. Your bid must be at least and they'll tell you what the actual floor bid is. So now that we know what the actual floor bit is, that gives me a lot of power. It means if I'm just dipping my toe in the water and I wanna test out the platform, I can do it at the very lowest risk to me. The biggest risk to you in bidding the floor is that maybe you're just not bidding high enough or aggressive enough to get LinkedIn to show your ads. And if that's the case, your campaign is not going to show any impressions or it's gonna slow down and show very few impressions. So all you have to do is come in here to your bidding and incrementally increase that until you do start getting traffic. So my recommendation here is to start out by bidding at the actual floor, and you end up setting your budgets, your daily budget's high. The reason for that is if you hit your budget sometime during the day, your whole campaign just shuts off. And so you don't know if that's really what you could spend. So for instance, if I'm bidding five dollars and thirty cents per click and I only have a ten dollar budget in in the campaign, it's possible that that campaign could spend ten dollars a day like it did or it could spend hundreds or even thousands and I just don't know. But if I set my daily budget really high, let's say I set it at a thousand dollars. I know it's realistically not going to hit that especially at such a low bid, but it lets me get an accurate perspective of at this bid level, how much can I actually spend? Once you're comfortable with the amount of traffic that a campaign is spending, or that an ad is spending, you can always come down and lower that daily budget to a safe place where, hey, if it if it hits its daily budget, I'm not gonna lose my job. Plus, if you hit your budget during the middle of the day, it means you were paying too much for your traffic. Ideally, if you're gonna bid all day long on the auction, You would want to spend your last cent at the very last moment, meaning that you spend evenly throughout the entire day. If you spend all of your budget before eleven AM, for instance, then you've essentially bid so aggressively that you then ran out of budget and LinkedIn had to shut your your campaign off. So I use this little rhyme to help me remember. If you hit your budget during the day, it means you paid too much for your clicks along the way. So here's my algorithm, my approach for how I make sure I'm always paying the least amount for LinkedIn traffic. And this is especially for sponsored content. If I launch an ad and I'm getting less than a point four five percent click through rate, I'm assuming I've done something wrong. My messaging is just not resonating with that audience, and I'm going to pause those ads and try something new. But if I'm getting somewhere between about point four five to one percent click through rates, I can give myself a pat on the back. I'm performing above average, And I can essentially lower my bids until I've spent as much as I actually want to spend naturally on that campaign. And then I'm getting the best and most efficient traffic. But what if I'm getting click through rates that are higher? If I'm getting a click through rate that is over one percent, that's when I know I can change my my bidding type to maximum delivery or auto bidding, and I'm going to show a lot more often because there's just no risk to LinkedIn when you're paying by the impression, they'll show it as much as they possibly can. And they're going to be giving you an effective reduction in rate, a discount on your cost per click because you're not paying by the click, you're paying by the impression. And you happen to be getting a really high click through rate. So use this strategy again to pay the least amount for all of your clicks. There is an option in your campaign settings that is automatically selected called enable audience expansion. And I want to share with you a hiku here that that a member of our team Eric wrote about audience expansion. Shows my ads to those outside defined targeting. That's dumb, really dumb. Thank you, Eric Jones. I highly, highly recommend don't use audience expansion at all. It's There's just never a case where it improves performance. All it does is muddy your targeting. So let's talk about the day parting and scheduling aspect of LinkedIn. Because we know there are certain times of the day where someone is really active on LinkedIn. It's often times during business hours. And then we know that there are times when they're going to be a lot less active. Well, because LinkedIn doesn't give us the ability to time our campaigns, We can assume that advertiser demand is flat across the whole day. But then watch this, this is all a curve based off of supply and demand. So we have inventory supply here, which is people logging in to LinkedIn. We'll oftentimes see that people start to log in really actively, when they wake up in the morning. So it might be six, seven, eight AM. We start to see a lot of traffic come on to LinkedIn. And then around lunchtime, maybe they they bow out. Maybe in the evening, they're not checking as often. And remember, this visualization is just for an idea. It doesn't represent how it actually works with anyone's given audience. So we know from economics that your cost is going to change based off of that supply and that demand. Well, if demand is staying constant and your supply is changing, then price is going to be the inverse of that. So watch what happens when we overlay price here. Now you have at the times of the day between like one AM to four AM when they're hardly anyone on LinkedIn, but advertisers are still bidding, your price is going to be relatively high. But when people start logging in and using LinkedIn during the business hours, you see that your effective costs will drop significantly. So what this tells me is if I had a limited amount of budget, I'd probably only want to spend it during the hours of the day where I know I got the best pricing and people tended to be the most active. So here's that concept written out. I won't read it to you, but feel free to check it out. Take a screenshot or whatever for for future reference. Because LinkedIn doesn't have a day parting or a scheduling tool within campaign manager, you either have to do it yourself or go to some third party who could help you do this. This generally starts out with just saying, hey, every morning I'm going to turn it on when I wake up or turn it on when I get into the office and then turn it off at a certain amount of time. Let's get into the juicy stuff here. Targeting is the reason that we pay a premium to advertise on LinkedIn. So let's talk about some advanced targeting tactics that you can use right now. First of all, are you targeting skills or groups? Like we recommended in the basics course, we love to target by skill plus seniority as well as groups plus seniority. But we also know that people who are trying to sell to your audience will oftentimes join the same groups, and add the same skills as those people to help them look more similar and facilitate conversations. So one thing that you can do if you're using either of these targeting criteria, is you can go and exclude the job functions that represent people who would be trying to sell to them. So for instance, you could exclude sales, business development, and marketing job functions. As long as you're not specifically trying to target one of those job functions to begin with. What about if you're targeting small to medium sized businesses? What you can do is you can go and target specifically by company size, And you could say, I only want to target companies between one to fifty employees, but what happens is LinkedIn only knows about a company size if they have gone and created a company page and reported it themselves. So there are probably two thirds of all smaller companies out there that don't have a company page on LinkedIn. They never thought to go create one. So what we've figured out is instead of going after specific one to fifty sized companies. Instead, if you exclude all companies that are fifty one and larger, what that leaves you with is definitely those companies who've reported being in the one to fifty range. But also those who are unreported, the ones that LinkedIn doesn't know. Again, that's probably two thirds of your audience. And now you're hitting people who other advertisers are not hitting, meaning that they're gonna be a lot less competitive, and you can probably see big cost decreases there. Have you thought about using age or years of experience in your targeting? What we found is those are actually not great targeting methods, because they're dependent on when the user first lists their first experience. And someone's first experience doesn't necessarily reflect, how much experience they have in the industry, or really how old they are. So instead, I like to just use seniority. I don't care if a senior VP is twenty years old or ninety years old, as long as they're in the position to make a decision about buying my product. And then like we talked about audience expansion, always make sure that's unclicked, avoid it like COVID nineteen. Now you're gonna go into your account and structure it. You want your account structure to reflect the very best ways to organize and report and make sense of everything. First off, don't name your campaigns after the piece of content you're promoting right now. Something like twenty twenty one webinar or white paper is not a great idea to name a campaign after. What we do like to name our campaigns after is actually the ad format we're using and the audience that we're targeting. Maybe even the objective that we selected. These are the three things that don't change in a campaign day to day. And so if I create my campaigns around audiences and around ad types, my account is going to be really clean. I'm not going to be constantly archiving old campaigns and letting them muck up the dashboard. Instead, I'm going to have fewer and evergreen campaigns. So then what I'll do is, at any time that I'm done running ads, I'll go into this existing campaign, pause my AB test. Let's say there's two ads in there. Pause them and then launch my two new ads in the in its place. This is the basics of a LinkedIn Evergreen strategy. Then I really like to micro segment my different campaigns. By audience. So for instance, if you do this the lazy way and you let's say you're targeting senior level marketers, you could go in and create a campaign that is just marketing job function with seniority's manager and above. They're all stuck within one campaign and you're done. And yes, that was fast. The problem is you might have CMOs who are really really high performance and you might have managers that are really low performance. And because they're all jammed into one audience together, you don't get any information about what you can change, adjust or optimize. So instead, let's break this out into four separate campaigns. I'll have a marketing managers campaign. A marketing directors, a marketing VP, and a CMO's campaign. So now I'm running the same ads in all four campaigns. Now I get to find out which of these audiences likes my content more? Who tends to be of higher performance, higher engagement, Further down the funnel, we can track and figure out, okay, of these seniorities, who does sales say are the highest quality of leads? These are all great things that you can know and you only know them if you've done this micro segmentation and broken them out. It's a few extra steps, but I guarantee the data that it generates and the insights will be far worth your time. Then with audience sizes, LinkedIn will constantly recommend to their advertisers to have audiences that are over three hundred thousand in size. The reason for this is very simple, if you have an audience of over three hundred thousand people, it's probably gonna spend a lot of money. And so whatever budget you've allocated to the platform, you're probably gonna spend it and that makes LinkedIn happy. But, I don't make money when you spend on on Linkedin. So, I only care about giving you the recommendation that's in your best interest. And that tends to be audiences between about twenty thousand and eighty thousand in size. If you get much smaller than twenty thousand, it's kind of hard to spend. You might not get enough data to actually tell whether something's working. And as soon as you get over about eighty thousand, then your audiences start to get large, and there might be some way that you could split that audience up into two pieces to again identify and kind of treat them like marketing focus groups. You get to learn how someone reacts based off of something that they are professionally. Then there's retargeting on LinkedIn, and we do have website retargeting. We've had it ever since twenty sixteen, I think. But this has been heavily influenced by what we're calling the the cookie apocalypse. This is all the browsers out there that are starting to ignore third party cookies, and this does things like making your conversion tracking and you're retargeting and your analytics a lot less reliable. So instead of just simply relying on LinkedIn's website retargeting, we have a new toolset in our tool belt. We call it engagement retargeting, and this is retargeting that happens right inside of LinkedIn itself. Which is really cool. It doesn't require a cookie for LinkedIn to know because when a user is logged in and they click on your ad, LinkedIn knows exactly who you are, and exactly what you clicked on and exactly who wants to retarget that action. So here are some of the retargeting audiences that you can set up. First, you can target people who've interacted with your lead gen forms. Either someone who just opened it or someone who submitted it. We can also target video viewers. Anyone who's watched at least twenty five percent of one of your video ads, we can put into an audience. We can target any visitor of the company's page. We can target the engagers, meaning they clicked on anything in a single image, sponsored content ad, or just the people who clicked on your call to action. Anyone who clicked on I'm attending on one of your LinkedIn events, you can also retarget them. And we love this feature. I hope LinkedIn continues to add more. They have they've added several just this year and this list will hopefully start getting a lot longer. One of the coolest things you can do on LinkedIn is called account based marketing. This is essentially advertising to very specific companies by name, because you have some reason to do so. Here are five things that you can go and do right now to make the most of account based marketing on LinkedIn. First of all, you could go and talk to your sales team and ask them who those dream accounts that they would absolutely love to work with are. If the sales team, let's say each sales rep comes up with twenty five or fifty companies that they would love to work with, you could then combine all of those into one list. Upload it into LinkedIn as a matched audience, and then run a campaign targeting just the right people at that list of companies. This is a great way to get sales and marketing, holding hands and singing Kumbaya. You could also upload a list of your competitors on LinkedIn. And not for targeting them, but use it for excluding. This is really difficult to do on any other ad platform, trying to get your competitors to not be able to see your ads and not cost you money when they click, but on LinkedIn, it's really simple and not enough people are using it. You could take a list of your customers, upload them into LinkedIn and exclude them from your current targeting. That's a great way of saying, hey, if you're already paying us money, I don't need to spend any more money to acquire you. Or you could take that same list that we're excluding and instead do a campaign just targeting your current customers. If you have a subscription model, this might be a great way of staying front and center with these people staying top of mind so that letting them know about new updates to your product or service so that when it comes time to renew that contract, they're going to be much more likely to do so. Then there's something I like to call funnel acceleration. This would be like, if I have a bunch of companies who are leads for me, but they haven't yet closed into deals or we haven't yet lost them. What I would do is upload that list into LinkedIn and target the whole buying committee around it. If I know that there's going to be deliberations about buying my product or service inside the company, every time they're on LinkedIn, I want to hit them with a message about my product or service. So by the time it crosses the CFO's desk and he or she has to sign for it, they're going, oh, I've heard of this company before. They must be legit. One thing that not a lot of advertisers consider is that when you're on LinkedIn, when you're running sponsored content ads, people can comment on them. It used to not be easy at all to monitor them. You would see interactions like this. Like when Jaguar is advertising and someone saying, please, Jaguar had so many issues with their gasoline cars and now launching electric, what a joke. Wow, that is ugly. Obviously, you don't want people saying that about your product. Look at this, you have some of these that are a week or four months old. They've been discouraging people from interacting with the ad and yet the advertiser didn't even know. If you're a company page admin, you can go in and delete these as they come. But there didn't used to be a good way to be alerted about this. You'd have to go in manually. But now, we do have something great that LinkedIn has been implementing. This is you'll actually get an email when you have a new comment on one of your ads. This was a great step. I highly applaud LinkedIn for coming out with this. Also, we started to get emails when a credit card may have failed in an account. We didn't used to get that. We would just log in to the account and see that it hadn't spent since yesterday. So I I love some of the new email alerts that we're getting. For those of you who are using Google Analytics, as your analytics solution, there's something called UTM parameters. And these are different query parameters that you can put in your URLs, so that when someone clicks on your ad and goes to your website, Google Analytics knows exactly where that traffic came from, how to categorize it, and and how to treat it. The main parameters are source medium, and campaign, and then there's two optional ones, there's content and there's term. I'm gonna share with you exactly how we tag with UTM parameters for Google Analytics customers, to just help you understand how we might organize this. So first off, our UTM source, we think of this as the platform. So we'll just put LinkedIn if the channel is linked in. For UTM medium, we like to use this as the ad type. So I might put SC if it's for sponsored content or it might be TA if it's a text ad or v I for video ad. You get the idea. Then under UTM campaign, I like to actually do a description of who that audience is professionally. Because this is so cool to be able to log in to Google Analytics and look at my page performance, my visiting performance, by the audience segment that I'm looking at. So for instance, you see here SC would be for sponsored content. WV would be for website visits, so that's the objective. And then I have a description of the audience. I have IT job function, plus VP and above seniority in North America. So you can see, I've I've encoded this a little bit. So if you don't know exactly what you're looking at, you might not be able to tell this might look like gobbledygook, but if I see this inside of Google Analytics or inside of a lead in my CRM, I know exactly which audience it was that drove that. And then finally, Google likes to say that the UTM content parameter describes the specific AB test variation. If it's in ads, it might be a unique content parameter per ad. And I love this approach. What I can do is put a unique UTM content parameter on every single one of my ads so that when one of those leads goes into my CRM and I'm reporting on it later, I can tell the exact ad that was created there. So this UTM content parameter probably looks crazy to you. LISC and then a bunch of numbers, Let me show you how I actually came up with that and we'll decode it. First of all, my first four letters are a combination of the source and the medium. So if this is LinkedIn sponsored content, it's LISC. If it's LinkedIn video ads, it might be LIVI. Then I know that if every one of these ads needs to be tracked uniquely, the easiest way to make something unique is to put the day's date in it. So, if I launched these ads on September thirtieth of two thousand twenty two, this would be the code I'd stick in the middle. Twenty two zero nine thirty. And then you follow it up with an incremental digit. If I'm launching ninety nine or fewer ads today, I can just put zero one, and drag that formula down in Excel and have it increment zero two zero three zero four do all the counting for me. However, you decide to do your tracking make sure that you're getting optimal vision on what's happening past the form fill, meaning things are happening in your CRM, that's gonna give you the very best chance of being able to figure out what's my ROI, what's my cost per sales qualified lead, all of that. Finally, I wanna walk you through my suggested account testing strategy. This is how you might format your account and design your campaigns. For running the optimal testing. First off, you have a persona that you're going after here. And we call them persona one, There's several different ways that we can target any one persona. We can target them usually by job title, by skills with seniority, by groups with seniority, sometimes we can target by interests in seniority, or job function plus seniority. But we'll start with just these three as an example. Then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to launch an a b test inside of the titles campaign, and I'm going to launch exactly the same a b test under the skills and the group's campaign. Now, what that's going to do for me is in any one of these campaigns, I might have Add A win, but Ad B actually would have been the winner. It's just LinkedIn made that decision too early. But now, I've spread that same AB test over multiple campaigns, there's a much lower chance that LinkedIn's going to make the wrong decision right up front about which ad is the winner and end up showing it too much or whatever. Plus, because the persona is the same, this is still the same, let's say it's a chief information officer, The persona is still the same whether we're targeting them by title or skill or group. So we can roll this performance up Our AB test in any one of these campaigns might not be totally statistically significant. We might not have enough data. But now if we combine all of the add a's performance and compare it to all of the add b's added together, we might be able to see statistical significance a lot earlier. Plus will get insights about which type of targeting got me a better quality lead at a lower cost. LinkedIn will start out your ads naturally, by optimizing for click through rates, which is exactly what you want. Avoid the option that says show ads evenly because it doesn't actually work very well. I call it the the charge me more and show me less button. What you're doing here, if you follow the structure, you're actually running a multi variant test. Multivariate tests are really hard to run.

Go search for the LinkedIn ads show podcast. In your podcasting app and make sure you're subscribed. We get really geeky on LinkedIn ads. So, if you've like this, you're gonna like that even more.

We also have other courses, we have the platform walk through, we have the basic course. This is the advanced and then we'll have a master class here next. There's a cool guide I did for Intuit.com that was a full walk through of how to get an account set up in the very best way for success. And finally, follow B2Linked on our YouTube channel for every time that I come out with a video of me doing some sort of an analysis or showing you how to do something in Excel, you'll be able to follow along. So I hope this was insanely valuable to you. I hope you got a ton out of it. Thanks for taking the course and sticking with me here. And I do hope you'll stick around for the master class here next in the sequence. Best of luck, and I'm cheering you on in your LinkedIn ads initiatives.
