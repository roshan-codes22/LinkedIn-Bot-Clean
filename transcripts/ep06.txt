Transcript:
This episode breaks down how to optimize your 
bidding and budgeting strategy on LinkedIn Ads
 to maximize performance. It explains when to use 
CPC, CPM, auto bidding
, or specialized formats like 
CPV and CPS
, depending on your goals and ad type. A key tip: 
start with CPC
, and once your 
click-through rate is 2.5x the average
, switch to CPM for better cost efficiency. You’ll also learn why the 
“Awareness” objective isn’t worth it
, and how to test bidding options for video campaigns to lower your effective cost per result.
You’ll also discover how to manage your 
daily budget like a pro
. Budgets act as 
safety nets, not performance levers
—so if you’re hitting your cap early, you’re likely bidding too high. Learn how to track flat spend patterns using 
performance charts
, and forecast your ad spend with tools like 
shape.io, adstage.io
, or even 
Google Sheets
. Whether you’re starting small or scaling fast, these strategies will help you make every dollar count.
