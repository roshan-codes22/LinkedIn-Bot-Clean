Summary:
Even when your LinkedIn Ads account is doing well, there are smart ways to boost performance further. Start by 
identifying and fixing underperformers
—this might mean pausing low-performing ads or campaigns, reducing bids, or trimming audience segments that don’t convert well. You can also improve cost efficiency by narrowing targeting, testing new ad creatives, or freshening up images to combat ad fatigue. Improving click-through rate (CTR) is one of the easiest levers to reduce cost per click (CPC) and increase volume. Use insights from tools like Stoke Analytics’ targeting audit to find wasted spend and tighten up your audience focus.
On the flip side, 
capitalize on your best-performing assets
 by increasing bids and budgets to get more volume without sacrificing cost efficiency. Launch A/B tests on already-successful creatives to find incremental wins, and experiment with new offers or even just reframe existing ones to improve conversion rates. Work closely with your sales team to close the feedback loop, and whenever possible, optimize based on deeper funnel metrics like MQLs, SQLs, or closed revenue—not just leads or CTR. Ultimately, the deeper your insights go, the more confidently you can scale performance and prove ROI, even in already-optimized accounts.
