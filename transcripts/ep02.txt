Episode 2 

Well, hi, everyone. I'm AJ Wilcox. I'm the founder of b2linked.com. And I'm so glad that you are joining us for our course on the basics of the LinkedIn ads platform. In this video, I'm going to walk you through the basics of the LinkedIn ads platform. Basic strategies that work, things that you need to be paying attention to. Now if you haven't watched the platform walk through, Definitely go and check that one out as well. They really work in companionship to each other. This one's going to teach you things like who should and shouldn't be advertising on LinkedIn. And what sorts of offers convert? What sort of ads are there out there? And which ones should I use? The different ad formats. So we're going to train on all of that today. So let's jump on in. Like I said before, I'm the founder of b two linked dot com, and we're an ad agency that literally only focuses on LinkedIn ads. I like to joke that we are a one trick pony and we do that trick very well. I stumbled on the LinkedIn ads about eleven years ago. I was the first digital marketer for a b to b SaaS company before it went public. And on my very first day of work, I went to go meet my new boss, the CMO, and I laid out all of my strategies for what I wanted to do in the position. My background was all in search engine optimization and in Google Ads. And so, I was very very focused on the Google ecosystem. And I remember her telling me, okay, all that sounds great. Go ahead and execute it. But just so you know, we started a pilot with LinkedIn ads about two weeks ago. So see what you can do with it. I actually ended up using a lot of the strategies that I was really familiar with and and advanced with in Google Ads. And then about two weeks later, one of my sales reps came up to me and said, AJ, we don't know what you're doing over here but we are fighting over your leads. Whatever you're doing, keep it up. So I was curious obviously. I went into our CRM and Salesforce at the time and I started looking at these leads that he was mentioning. And without fail, every single one of them was from LinkedIn ads. And it was not the only ad channel I was running. Is very surprising. So over the course of the next two and a half years, I grew that account from two campaigns to six hundred and fifty plus. The performance from LinkedIn ads was so good that I eventually just handed off my SEO duties and my Google ads duties to other co workers and agencies so I could focus full time on LinkedIn. It became the company's largest source of leads and profits and the sales team all love the leads. So that was why I went all in on on LinkedIn. I saw the results. I saw the difference in lead quality that you can get from LinkedIn versus all the other channel. I live in the great state of Utah in the United States. I have four wild children whom I absolutely adore and I love anything that goes fast. I love exotic cars. I own a go kart. I love off roading, dirt biking, all of that good stuff. As a company, we've spent over a hundred and fifty million dollars on LinkedIn ads. So we've run a few tests. We've managed five of Linkedin's top ten spending customers. So we definitely have the experience there. I'm going to share with you the benefit of everything we've learned. I'm also the host of the LinkedIn ads show podcast. So if you start to geek out about this kind of stuff with me, you love what I'm teaching you, you're gonna love the podcast even more. Alright. Let's go ahead and jump into the content here. So first off, the challenges in other channels that you probably want to be listening for that LinkedIn ads might be able to solve. So first off, are you hearing your sales team talking about low lead quality from either Google or Facebook? And when I say Facebook, you can think Instagram as well. The challenges with these platforms is they are predominantly built for B2C. They're built around consumers. And so they have a hard time trying to piece together and tie together professional details, whereas on LinkedIn, the targeting is totally built around who someone is professionally. So you might notice that the more you try to scale up your Facebook or Google efforts in the b to b side, you'll notice that lead quality tends to decrease and it can be a challenge for sales teams. The other thing you might notice is that as you're trying to scale up either of these platforms, you notice that you'll very quickly hit a diminishing returns point. With Google it's very pronounced because there's only that many people out there who are searching for your keywords at any given time. So as soon as you start to expand and try to scale that past a certain point, you'll start targeting keywords that are not nearly as relevant to your business or relevant to someone taking action right now. So that can be frustrating to you as a marketer. The other thing on Facebook is that again, if you try to scale, you start reaching more and more people who are less and less like the professionals that you want to do business with you. So if you have challenges with either of these things, either diminishing returns or low lead quality from your other marketing channels, then LinkedIn ads might be your answer. The great things about the platform are first of all the targeting. The targeting is why we pay a premium to advertise on LinkedIn. We're able to target very specific job titles, seniorities, company names, it goes on and on and we'll get to a lot more of the targeting. But what's so cool is the vast majority of white color professionals in the world have a LinkedIn profile. So it's very rare when you have a budget that's larger than you're actually able to spend on your most ideal customer. We see a lot of our clients who managing budgets across multiple channels. And eventually, when they see the lead quality coming through, and the return on their investment happening, they start shifting their budgets from Google and Facebook over into LinkedIn. Another great thing about LinkedIn is that we as users, we tend to keep our profiles up to date. And I don't know if any of you have ever bought a list. It was crazy when I used to buy lists, I would send out emails to them and get like thirty percent bounces. And it's like you bought this list of the right kind of people, but thirty percent of them don't work there anymore, their email addresses are dead. And then ten percent have moved on to different positions and there isn't a great way of keeping up on that kind of information. But with LinkedIn, there is because the way that I feel is that LinkedIn is a representation of my professional self. So when I make a change professionally, the first thing I do is tell my LinkedIn profile and then I tell others. So because this happens, we find that our ads are constantly reaching the right people we're not reaching people who no longer have that job title anymore. Another fantastic thing about the platform is that when you are on LinkedIn, you're in the right mentality. You're thinking about your job, you're thinking about your career, how to further those things. And so when I show you an ad that shows you how to further your career, then you're going to be paying a lot more attention to it. So, we get a nice little bump from just people being in the right mindset. Whereas on Facebook, they might be saying, oh, that ad looks interesting, but I'm on my way to look at pictures of my grandkids or go play Farmville. It happens. And then finally, we've compared LinkedIn across all the different other channels, we find that LinkedIn always closes the largest deal sizes. I think this makes sense because we can be so specific about who we target with our LinkedIn ads that if you're only targeting the right seniorities to be able to purchase from you the companies that are large enough to have the right budget for you, of course, you're gonna close your largest deals from them. What is interesting though is that LinkedIn deals don't close as fast as Google because anything dealing with search has people who are actively searching for what it is you do, because there's either a need right now or the timing's right. And so that can be helpful. If you're looking to get funnel acceleration, to close deals as fast as possible, targeting very bottom of the funnel keywords on Google is probably your best bet. But if you want the largest deals the ones that you are most proud of to put their logo on your website and say, this is one of our customers, then LinkedIn ads is definitely for you. Like I alluded to you before, we pay a premium to advertise on LinkedIn, and the costs are truly high compared to about any other platform you can find out And so because the costs are high, it means we have to take some things into consideration that maybe LinkedIn have priced themselves out of the market for some types of businesses. So let's talk about who the right kinds of businesses are, who should be advertising on LinkedIn. So first of all, if you have large lifetime values or high deal sizes, and when I say large lifetime values, I generally thinking, like, when you do business with a customer, if you're gonna make ten thousand or fifteen thousand dollars or more from the lifetime of that deal, then I would call that very large. If you are doing lead generation to find those kinds of deals, then LinkedIn is probably your bread and butter. It's fantastic for this. Generally, what we find is you'll spend somewhere between about two thousand dollars to seven thousand dollars in advertising to close a customer. So if that customer is worth fifteen thousand dollars or more to you, then it's a total no brainer. Right? That leaves plenty of margin to compensate a sales rep for closing it for financing future ad spend, even hiring an agency to manage and then still have profit on top. The next usage of LinkedIn ads that's really helpful is for recruiting, white collar recruiting usually. When you're looking to hire, and you're saying, hey, I know the kinds of people who have experience for this position have this job title or they worked at this company in the past. Or, you know, they're this seniority currently. You can target people by any of those things, by years of experience and show them an ad that essentially says, we're interested in you for this position. Are you interested in applying? And you can get some great results. For a lot of our clients, we're working with their marketing department to do lead generation, but then we're also working with their HR department to run recruiting campaigns that are highly targeted. Because we use LinkedIn, you might think, oh, my HR department, they're using their LinkedIn rep and going through LinkedIn recruiter. What's interesting is we always outperform what they do. They don't get nearly as targeted, they don't get nearly as creative. So that means you can do it better yourself if you want to take that over from your HR department. It's cool experience. We also find that higher ed tends to work really really well. It's very rare out there to find an MBA program who's not recruiting on LinkedIn. And that's because we can target people who have a bachelor's degree, but don't yet have a master's and those who went to a certain school, there's lots of great things for higher ed specifically. We've also found some business to consumer kinds of applications for LinkedIn ads, like for instance, financial services credit card companies, investment advisors, people like that where like the lifetime value of that customer is still really high because they're gonna stay with you for a long time. So LinkedIn tends to do really really well with them. We've also seen the luxury carmakers like Mercedes Audi, BMW, Jaguar, They all do advertising on LinkedIn as well. So obviously, when you have large enough margins on your vehicles, you can afford LinkedIn's advertising and targeting there. So whenever you're advertising on LinkedIn, it's similar to that of any other social campaign. And I came up with this acronym ammo. It's the three pillars, the three things that you need in order to advertise on social media. You need a, your audience, who it is you're targeting, m your message, what it is you're actually showing them, what your imagery or video looks like, which ad format you're using. And then of course by far, it's the most important you need to owe your offer. This is what it is you are offering your prospects in exchange for their attention. This could be anything from read this blog post or look at my logo to buy something from me now. We'll talk about the different kinds of offers and what tends to perform and what doesn't, but that's the basics here. So be thinking about what your ammo bring your ammo to social advertising. First off, we'll jump into the message portion. So we'll talk about each of the different ad formats that you can use on LinkedIn, and which ones are probably more worth your effort if you're just getting started. So right off the bat, let's talk about single image sponsored content. Now, single image sponsored content is by far my favorite. It's the one that we use the most often. You can see here on the slide, I recommend it ninety five percent of the time. That means ninety five percent of the time, a new advertiser who's just getting started this is the ad format they're going to run almost exclusively. What's great about this ad format is it shows up right in the news feed. And there are several different ad formats that utilize the news feed, but just so you know, the news feed is the default experience whether someone logs into LinkedIn on their mobile device, on the app or on desktop. It's the first thing they see which means you're gonna get a lot of impressions, a lot of opportunities for people to see these ads. So it's a great ad format. The other thing that makes it great is there's enough room to tell any story you want. You get like a hundred and fifty characters of text up above. You can do more but we we recommend a hundred and fifty. You get this big beautiful image in between and that can be either horizontal, square, or vertical, and you get this headline down below that we like to stay under about fifty five characters for. And we found that in that setup, in that space, we can communicate about any offer and communicate the value. So this is a great starting ad format. It's one where you can run about any offer that you can figure out. You can expect your costs per click, to range anywhere between about eight to fourteen dollars, especially starting out on a low budget. You can expect somewhere in the eight to nine dollar click you know, cost per click range. If you are running a larger budget, you may have to bid up and be a little a little more aggressive getting towards that fourteen dollar mark. If you're paying significantly higher than that, there's probably something wrong and you need to figure it out because you're paying LinkedIn far too much money. The average click through rate from these ads is about point four four percent. So it's a little bit less than half a percent of the time that these are shown. Someone will click. So keep that in mind, you may find that your ads are performing about there, which means you should probably change it up because you always want to perform better than benchmark. Or you might find that you are performing significantly higher than that. Maybe you're over one or two percent and you're doing great. Keep that in mind. Next, we've got text ads and these ones, they show up over in the right rail of LinkedIn only on desktop. So that means immediately you're not gonna get any mobile traffic from these. And you can see here on the screen, they're kind of hard to see, but there's three little thumbnails with little ads next to them. When you run a text ad, you're automatically competing with at least one, if not two other advertisers in this slot. They're kind of hard to see here on the slide because they're kind of hard to see in real life. And we actually see this from the average click through rates. You remember the last ad format I showed you had an average click through rate of about point four four percent. These, if you get a point zero two five percent Meaning two and a half clicks out of every ten thousand times these are shown, then you're doing great. Like that's average. So keep that in mind, these aren't ads that get a ton of traffic. I think because they are in the right rail, they're obviously ads, they don't attract very much attention. But I absolutely love this ad format especially when it's used in conjunction with others. The reason why is because it's LinkedIn's cheapest ad format. You'll oftentimes pay between three to six dollars per click, which is great. You can actually bid all the way down to two dollars if you want. If you don't need very much traffic. And, you know, because this click through rate is so low, it means these ads are showing a ton of times almost every time that page is loaded when someone's navigating around LinkedIn, they may see your logo, they may see your ad. And we find just by running text ads at the same time as we run single image ads, we find that our click through rates on single image, tend to increase by thirteen percent on average. So pretty cool to provide some lift and they're so low risk because they'll never spend all of your budget and if they do, they're the cheapest cost per click. So you'll get really really good quality leads for not very much money. So I do recommend these as the next ad format you choose to take on. Next, we have dynamic ads. Now, there are two different classes of dynamic ads. I'm just going to show you the one, but they are over in the right rail. The one that you see here on screen is called a spotlight ad, meaning that it takes up the whole three hundred by two fifty block that text ads oftentimes take up, so they do share inventory. The reason they're called dynamic ads is because you have this option to insert the prospect's picture into the ad in order to get their attention. This earns them the title of sometimes called LinkedIn's creepiest ad format. But spotlight ads let you take that traffic wherever you want. So in this case, when I click the request fifty dollar credit button. It's gonna take me to a page, this is put on by LinkedIn, but if it's were one of our clients, it would take you to their landing page. There's also a version of this called follower ads and this is by far the most efficient way to pay for followers to your company page. We do have clients who specifically want more followers so that their organic content performs better for free in the future and this is how you do it with dynamic ads. You can expect really low click through rates. They are higher than text ads because you're not sharing that space with two other advertisers. But on average, we'll pay six to eight dollars per click on these. They used to be priced much higher. You used to have to pay fifteen to eighteen dollars per click on these. But now LinkedIn lowered the cost and we're a lot happier, which means I can actually recommend these. Again, they're in the right rail, so only desktop traffic is going to come, which may or may not be a good thing for you, depending on how you treat your mobile traffic. Next, we have message ads, Message ads, I only recommend about five percent of the time, and the reason why is because they are LinkedIn's most expensive ad format. And LinkedIn will actually talk about this like it's their cheapest ad format, but there's some confusing stuff going on, so I'll clear that up for you. First off, on these ones, as opposed to all the other ads I've shown you before, where you can say, I only want to pay when someone clicks on this. That means I don't pay anything if someone's not taking the action that I want, that's great. So you're going to pay per person you send this to. And then, on average, it's going to have a fifty five percent open rate. So only a little over half of the people you send it to are going to even look at your message. And then of those who look at your message, only three point two percent of those end up clicking on your call to action. So if you're measuring what your cost per click is, that means a cost per person clicking showing interest enough to have an opportunity to convert on my offer. You're in the twenty three to sometimes over sixty dollar range. Per click. That's not per conversion. What this tells me is it's not that this is a bad ad. It means you have to use it in very specific circumstances. In this one, you have to have an offer that feels very personal. Feels like a personal invitation. And these do actually come from a person. You could have come from the company if you have a LinkedIn rep, but usually you're gonna choose someone's LinkedIn profile to have this message come from them. And so it does need to feel personal if you have your CEO reaching out to someone with this ad format, inviting them to a webinar, that's not very believable. People are gonna be like, the CEO doesn't have time to be sending me this message. But you can imagine if someone were inviting you to a free in person event or saying you look qualified for this position we're hiring for, would you like to apply? Or because you're an influencer, we want to give you early access or a sneak peek at something that your your colleagues and followers might be interested in. Those kinds of offers feel very personal. I would not use these ads simply to just get people to download a white paper or a guide or or join a webinar unless it feels very personal. So, I call that a VIP offer. You want a VIP offer for They also do tend to work pretty well for retargeting. When you know someone already knows your brand, they've already interfaced with you somehow, then these message ads can work pretty well. They go into someone's message box, so it's not while they're surfing around LinkedIn. It's when they're in their messages and it comes across like it's an inmail. These are really interesting because they have a really low frequency cap. Meaning that any member of LinkedIn can only receive one of these every thirty days. So they're kind of exclusive, you kind of own someone's inbox for those thirty days. Then there is another version of sponsored messaging called conversation ads. This is one of the newer ones. I tend to recommend these a little bit more than message ads, they come the same way. You you pay percent, they come into someone's message box. But instead of it just being basically an email that they can read and take action or just mark as red and move on. These ones are a choose your own adventure. It's like a chatbot experience, where you can give them multiple options. One of the ways I like to think of these is if you were saying like, hey, are you going to this industry event or trade show next month? And if they say yes, you can say, cool, come visit us at our booth. We'd love to give you some swag and show you a demo. Or if they say no, you could say, well, afterwards we're gonna do a wrap up of everything we learned and everything that's new in the industry. Click here to sign up for our webinar or live stream where we're gonna walk you through all that. So basically just giving someone more opportunities to convert. Because you get more opportunities to convert, we find that these tend to convert and perform about thirty percent better than just standard message ads. It does still need a VIP offer. There still needs to be a reason for someone to be reaching out with this. But and they are cumbersome to build. When we go to build sponsored content campaigns, those ads take less than a minute to build. When we build message ads, they take about five minutes per message ad to build. When we build a conversation ad, these are more like thirty minutes. LinkedIn has given us some templates to work with, but they are really cumbersome to build and you should consider that as you're looking to build them. LinkedIn does have video ads. These play in the news feed just like you'd expect from any other social platform. They do play muted by default, which means that probably eighty percent or higher of the people who view your ad are going to view it with the sound off. That means you're gonna wanna make sure you have subtitles in there, and that your video is very easy to to view and understand without the sound being on. With these, you end up paying by the view. You'll pay anywhere between about ten to thirty five cents per person who watches at least two seconds of the video. Two seconds is not very long, so you will end up paying for a lot of people. But one thing that I really like about video ads, is you can communicate so much more emotion. The buying decision is all about getting someone to know like and trust you. And if you watch me for two minutes on video, you're gonna be a lot more likely to know, like, and trust me. Then if you downloaded like five of my guides or ebooks or, you know, read five of my blog posts. It's just so much easier to communicate those emotions. The other thing I really like about them is that when someone watches at least twenty five percent of one of your video ads, you can then add them to a retargeting audience. And show them the next ad in the sequence. Pretty cool. Then we have carousel ads. Carousel ads are a direct port over from Facebook. You can see here on the slide that I recommend them zero percent of the time, that's because we haven't found very many cases where carousel ads could outperform anything else. They tend to be about twenty percent more expensive than single image ads and they take more time to build because it's like having to build multiple ads inside of one ad. But if you need to communicate a visual story, what you can do here that works really well is have your designer create like a really long image and then split it up into ten eighty by ten eighty panes. That someone might want to swipe through on mobile and you could tell a visual story. I like the idea of doing a comic in here, where someone can thumb through the comic and then click to your landing page after. Of all of the different times we've tested these, we've only found twice where these performed even halfway decently, But it's important to know that they do exist, should you have a need for this kind of being able to to swipe through kind of flow. Several years back, LinkedIn came out with a new kind of ad. They call it an ad format, but I consider it more of an add on to the existing ad format. They call them LinkedIn, LeaveGen formats. So what these are is when someone interacts with your ad, a little drawer will slide down and form fields will be there. The cool part about this is that LinkedIn's going to autofill anything that they know about that person, So, if you're asking for first name, last name, email, job title, company name, company size, any of that stuff that Linkedin knows, it's gonna be automatically filled out. It loads instantly because it's right on LinkedIn, and especially for someone who's on a mobile device where typing out all of that stuff would be really hard. And really daunting to do, all they have to do is just hit that submit button and they go. LinkedIn came out with these specifically because when Advertisers would come and they would send traffic to their landing pages, they'd go back to LinkedIn and say, hey, LinkedIn, your traffic doesn't convert. And LinkedIn was like, well, we know it's the right traffic and they couldn't defend themselves. So what they did is they came out with the lead generation forms where it loads immediately people trust LinkedIn, that's why they're there and so they will submit forms much more often on LinkedIn versus someone else's website. And by being able to test the two, they can very quickly point out and say, oh, it's actually your website. Your landing page isn't building enough trust. It's not it's taking too long to load, it's not providing enough value. All of these things are things that could cause your conversion rates to drop. So we tend to like these About seventy percent of our clients run these exclusively and they can be attached to anything that's in the news feed that we call sponsored content, or any of the sponsored messaging ad formats, the ones that show up in your message box. They tend to convert much higher than landing pages, you can see here thirty to one hundred and fifty percent higher conversion rates. It makes a big difference to your cost per lead. You can also retarget people who've either triggered to open the form and or those who have submitted the form and become a lead. But because LinkedIn has made it so easy to convert on these, your sales team will probably report leads coming in with a little bit lower of lead quality. It's not because your targeting is bad, It just It's because you made the process so easy for them to convert, that there were probably quite a few people on your website who were on the fence about filling out the form, but decided to back out last minute, whereas on LinkedIn, it captured them. Once the leads go into LinkedIn, they're kind of hard to get out. You can either go in and manually download a CSV every day, and then deal with those leads however you normally would. But if someone requests something or becomes a lead, you don't wanna get back to them twenty four hours later. It just it's a bad experience. They're thinking about it now, you need to be with them now. So, what you probably wanna do is do one of the integrations that LinkedIn has. They have integrations with many of the standard CRM tools or marketing automation systems. So if you're using Eliqua, Marketo, HubSpot, Salesforce, probably Microsoft Dynamics since Microsoft owns LinkedIn. These are all systems that you can pipe these leads directly in. And create flows and send people what you promised them, add them to your CRMs, all that. If you do not happen to have one of the platforms that they integrate with natively, You can use zapier dot com. Last I checked, the twenty dollar per month zapier dot com plan would allow you to export your leads and do whatever you want with them. Zappier can connect to about any CRM out there, any marketing automation system. It can add leads to a Google sheet that the sales team works out of, etcetera, etcetera. Now, let's talk about the targeting side of LinkedIn, because this is the biggest reason why we want to use LinkedIn. We can target people by who they are professionally. So things like their job title, their job function, or what department they work in, their levels of seniority. Individual skills that are on their profile or the groups that they're members of. I can hear you Facebook advertisers just drooling over the concept of being able to target people by the group that they're in. Can't do that on Facebook, but we've been able to do it on LinkedIn ever since two thousand and eight when the platform came out. We can target specific companies, whether it's the company name, the size the number of employees or the the size of revenue. We can target the industry that they're in, their company growth rate, lots of cool tools around companies. We can target education like we talked about a little while ago. We can also do list uploads, which means I can upload a list of contacts of people to either advertise to or exclude from my ads, and that's a really powerful tool. You can do that with up to three hundred thousand in a single list. But what I'm even more excited about is this ability to do the same thing, but with company names. You can literally take a list of up to three hundred thousand companies upload it into LinkedIn and then either target or exclude those companies. Such a cool thing. We have the demographics like age, gender, location, and a whole bunch of other things. Everything I've mentioned is probably only about a third of what LinkedIn's targeting options give you. So go in and explore and check those out. What I love is that we can use the vast majority of these targeting options to combine with each other to make an ultra targeted audience. So for instance, if I'm selling HR software, I can say, I only want this ad to be seen by people who are in HR. And their seniority is director and above. And they're at a tech company with at least five hundred people in it in North America. That's the kind of targeting that you can do when you combine. Like I alluded to before, you can also exclude. I could say for instance, like, hey, here is a list of my current customers. I want to exclude them from my advertising, so I'm not paying for people I've already acquired. Or here's a list of of my competitors. I wanna upload that and exclude that from all of my ads so that my competitors don't see my ads. Pretty cool. But to see all of those targeting options, it can be a little bit daunting. So, here's what I recommend from an organization perspective. I find that the vast majority of the time an audience persona can be targeted in four different ways. We can target them by their job title, we can target them by their department with their seniority. We can target them by their skills with seniority, and we can target them by groups with seniority or without. So for instance, I could do something like, if I want to target chief information officers and chief technology officers. I could obviously target them by that job title, that's one campaign. The next one I could do is job function or department of IT, with a CXO or a C level seniority, that's the same people, but a different way of reaching them. So that's now two campaigns. I could also do deep IT skills, like skills you would only list on your profiles if you knew what you were talking about in IT. And then layer on a c level seniority, a CXO on top of that. And again, you end up with these chief level IT people. You could also target groups So if you're a member of a group that's all about IT and then you layer on CXOS and you're already on that, again, you're probably reaching these same people. You could also target just groups who have CIO and CTO in the name, meaning the group doesn't allow people who don't already have that job title, and now you're you're getting more of the right people into your audience with less targeting. What you'll find over time is that by running these four campaign structures all next to each other, each one is going to have a little bit different of a personality. You might find that skills brings in really broad targeting and the sales team doesn't like it as much, but it also gives you a lot more scale, so it may be helpful to your volume. You might find that job title targeting is really expensive, but the leads that come in from it are really high quality. So as you figure these things out, you can bid one down, bid one up, give one more budget, less budget. You could shut one off entirely. And you can if you can find a way to reach your prospects in a way that your competitors have not and for less money, wow, there's power in that. I guarantee your competitor is probably not going to spend the time to do this level of of targeting and finding lower costs on LinkedIn. Leaving you to win. As we're working through ammo, we get to owe our offer. And like I said, this is the most important part of what we're doing. Because you have to offer someone something of a lot of value in exchange for them to take action or for them to give you their attention. What we find because LinkedIn's costs are so high, it can be difficult for people to pay you know eight to fourteen dollars per click to get someone to read a blog post or listen to a podcast episode. You know, one of those things that isn't gated that it's not going to turn into a lead necessarily. Those don't tend to have strong calls to action. And so at some point, if that's your strategy, you're gonna have to explain to someone why you have five hundred to a thousand dollar cost per lead. You're definitely doing good work. Like exposure to your brand and branding is so so important, but oftentimes we find that it's better to start kind of in the middle. If you go right to asking someone to take a trial of your software, or hop on the phone with a sales rep for a demo or buy something now, it's it's asking too much too soon. It's like going on a first date and proposing marriage. It's like, you might be great marriage material, but if you're asking for marriage right now, you might be a little desperate, and I'm not interested. So if you do that, you'll end up paying a lot per lead because there will be people who are curious like, what what's this demo they're asking me about? They'll click, it'll charge you money, but only like one and a half to four percent of people will convert. So where you probably want to start if you're just getting started, is by offering something of great value in exchange for them to fill out a form and basically expose themselves, identify themselves to you. I I call this the sweet spot where it's high enough in value but low enough in friction that you will actually get names coming into your database. You'll you'll get leads for your sales team to follow-up on. Those types of things might be, like, here's a free checklist or a cheat sheet. A free guide, a free webinar, a free ebook, a free in person event. Those types of things where they are gated, you are gonna have someone fill out a form. In order to register. If you're there in the sweet spot and your offer is good, you'll probably be paying somewhere between about twenty five to seventy dollars per per lead or per conversion that comes in, and then your sales team can follow-up after that. So keep that in mind. If you're too high, you might be in the five hundred dollars to one thousand dollars mark, at least in North America where our prices are higher. If you go to the bottom straight for trial and demo or purchase, you might be in five hundred to a thousand dollar cost per lead, but there in the middle, you're gonna see a vast reduction there. Let's talk about retargeting. LinkedIn does have a retargeting platform just like about every ad platform out there, but their website retargeting feature is really weak. And I'll explain why. It's a hundred percent based off of cookies. And as I'm sure most of you know, we're kind of in the midst of the cookie apocalypse, where third party cookies are going away, and browsers aren't even going to be using these anymore. So what we have here is you have to have at least three hundred people with cookies in their browser in your audience before you can even advertise. When you do advertise, you're still gonna be paying six to eight dollars per click. So it's not huge discounts. And because it's a hundred percent based on cookies, you're gonna be driving a lot of people to your website in order to build up enough people who their browsers are allowing cookies to be in that audience. Once they're in, they're only gonna live for one hundred and eighty days. So every one hundred and eighty days your audience is totally flushed out again. So I look at this and go, not a great value proposition. Not that you shouldn't use LinkedIn's retargeting, but you should probably plan on utilizing other channels and other retargeting platforms to bolster your LinkedIn performance. If you are only retargeting on LinkedIn, it's not really the platform that people come to hang out on a lot. People tend to go to LinkedIn last stat I heard was something like seventeen minutes per week on average. Whereas on Facebook, They're therefore thirty minutes per day or more. And that's, of course, shifted towards Instagram and very much TikTok as well. So LinkedIn's not really the platform that you're going to stay top of mind with very well, with very many people. So I looked at their website retargeting and go, okay, it's good. I'll set it up, but I'm not gonna rely wholly on. So what can we do? Well, when we're driving traffic from LinkedIn to your website, We know that Google ads retargeting goes and reaches everyone across the whole Google display network, which is last time I checked, the AdSense network is like, like ninety percent of websites out there or web pages out there. You also have access to Facebook's custom audience retargeting, and Facebook has access to them anytime they're on a Facebook property. So Facebook, Instagram, maybe in the future like Oculus VR. So Facebook owns a lot of stuff, it's a great way to stay front and center. Retargeting is all about staying in front of someone to remind them and help you stay top of mind. So being on any sort of platform that has access to a lot more inventory where people spend time is great. The other thing we can do on LinkedIn is we can utilize their retargeting that is on platform. So, it has retargeting options of things like we talked about, if you open or submit a lead generation form. You can be put into an audience. If you watch at least twenty five percent of a video ad, you can then be put into an audience for retargeting. If you interact with a single image sponsored content ad in any way, where if you click on its call to action, you could be put into an audience. If you visit someone's company page organically, you can be put into an audience for retargeting. I think LinkedIn is going to keep coming out with these, and I'm a huge fan because it doesn't rely on cookies. This is one hundred percent like LinkedIn knows who you are and what you clicked on and so they can then hand that information to an advertiser for great targeting. As you go out to start creating your ads, I wanna share with you our formula for how we found our ads to perform significantly above the average. First of all, when we're writing ad copy, you have to realize that these are busy people they're not looking forward to reading ads and they're kind of daunting. So you wanna keep things short and to the point with as much value front loaded as possible. Keep in mind what I call everyone's favorite radio station, w I I f m, it stands for what's in it for me. Of course, as a marketer, you want to tell them like, hey, I want you to convert here so I can get a raise. But they don't care about that. They only care what's in it for them. So, you need to express that very clearly in the ad copy. Here is the value we're providing you. You're gonna be educated and learn about something. You'll have your problem solved, all of those kinds of benefits that you can provide. And don't be afraid to give someone a strong called action. You don't want to beat around the bush. If you want someone to download your guide, say something like download the free guide today. Download the free guide now, you know, that kind of thing. Then there's the imagery. Your imagery and or video, they all kind of play the same way. But what you want is LinkedIn is very like blues, grays, and whites in its color palette. So if you want something to stand out, designers will tell you this, you can go look at the color wheel, look at where blue is, and whatever is opposite of blue is going to stand out the most. It's going to pop. That color happens to be orange. So if you want your ads to pop, try to saturate them in things like oranges, reds, greens, purples, pinks, those are gonna help it stand out. If it just blends into everyone else's news feed, they won't even take the time to read the ad copy that you wrote. Don't expect your imagery to convert people. Don't put too much text in it that tries to talk people into why they should convert. The job of your image is just to get someone to slow down so that they will actually read your ad copy. I like to abide by the Billboard rule. When I used to buy billboard media, the reps would tell me, try to keep your billboards to seven words or less. Because if it has more than that, people who are driving on the freeway aren't gonna get the gist before they have to look away. But if it's seven or fewer words, people can still just look at where they're driving and still be safe drivers but still get the point of what you're offering. Do the same thing with your LinkedIn ads. Try to keep it with the Billboard rule of seven words or less. Here's an example of a very high performing ad that we ran that I wanna walk you through. So first off, you can see the intro section. We like keep it around a hundred and fifty characters or less. It contains two things. It's number one, why you should pay attention. And number two, it gives a strong call to action. If your ads do this, they'll tend to perform much better. You also have the headline down below that we like to put two things in there. If it's a downloadable asset, we'll put in square brackets what kind of an asset they could expect. This one just says download, but you could imagine something like free infographic or free cheat sheet or free guide. And then, You've worked really hard on titling that asset to show how much value is in it. This is where you wanna list your title. You can see from this image, it kind of breaks some of our rules. It's not heavily saturated in oranges, reds, purples. What it is is it looks very organic. This was our client just took a picture of one of their co workers at their desk. And we were targeting very high level and large companies sales leadership. So this was like senior sales leadership at enterprise sized companies, and this probably looks a lot like what they see when they walk out on their floor, or at least they did before COVID. Now by far, the reason why this ad performed so well was the offer itself. If you read through this, you get it immediately. We analyzed over eighteen million emails and found the six best practices that you can use to increase your open rates today. That's a very strong value to a company who's going, wow, if we can even see a ten percent lift on our sales, like we're all going home with bonuses. So you can imagine how like why this performed so well. But if you follow this guide for how to write your ad copy, you will generally outperform LinkedIn's benchmarks by two to three times which is fantastic. If you are just getting started on LinkedIn, you haven't even created an account yet or you're just getting ready to start advertising, we built a checklist. This is the eight things that you need in order to start advertising. We built it because when I first advertise on any channel I usually have high hopes about like, oh, I'm gonna get these TikTok ads up today and I get in and realize, oh, I have to do this. I have to get access to that. And it ends up becoming a much larger thing. So, what we wanted to provide for you was, here's the checklist of everything you need in order to start advertising today.
