Summary 
Most advertisers on LinkedIn fail to use its targeting features systematically. In this episode, AJ Wilcox shares five frameworks to master audience segmentation and take full control of ad spend, lead quality, and performance. Start with 
company-level targeting
 (by size or using “unknowns” for cheap, untapped audiences), and use 
company name targeting
 manually for small lists or via Matched Audiences for accuracy. Then, apply 
role-based targeting
 using job title, function, skills, and groups—each offering a different balance between cost and precision.
Break your audiences into micro-segments—by seniority, company size, or targeting type—to find what works best and scale it. Finally, refine with filters like education, experience, interests, and email retargeting. The key takeaway: 
each campaign should act like a mini focus group
—the more granular your segmentation, the better your results. For a head start, grab AJ’s free checklist at B2Linked.com/checklist.
