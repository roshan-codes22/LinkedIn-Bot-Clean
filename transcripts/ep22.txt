Summary
If your LinkedIn Ads are performing well and you’re ready to scale, there are 
three strategic levers
 you can pull to grow without sacrificing efficiency. First, expand your 
audience size
—ideally by targeting the same persona through different methods like job functions, skills, groups, or ABM lists. You can also broaden the persona itself by including additional roles, seniorities, or industries that make sense for your offer. This is the most efficient scaling strategy, because it typically 
maintains your current cost per lead
. It’s also smart to use lookalike audiences or upload email lists if you want to scale while staying relevant.
The second lever is to 
improve click-through rates
 by testing new messaging, imagery, and even offers. This will help you extract more traffic from the same audience. Finally, once those avenues are exhausted, you can 
increase your bids
 to win more impressions—but this often leads to diminishing returns. Bidding higher will raise your CPC and cost per lead, so it should be your last resort. Done in order—expand, optimize, then bid—you can 
scale LinkedIn Ads profitably
 without losing control of your budget.
