Show Transcript:
 Your company's reputation and lack of social proof are the silent killers of your LinkedIn ads. We're teaching you how to fight back on this week's episode of the LinkedIn ad show.
 Welcome to the LinkedIn ad show. Here's your host, AJ Wilcox.

I absolutely had to bring him on and teach us how all of this applies to LinkedIn campaigns. I've known DJ for lots of years now. He's always been my go-to resource for any question I have about reviews. I'm really excited to get to introduce you to it.

DJ, thank you so much for joining us here on the LinkedIn ad show.
 Thanks, AJ. Really excited to be here. This is something I've been looking forward to for some time.
 We're going to be talking about reputation management specifically. And I know this is going to kind of intersect with some of the questions I'm going to ask you, but can you just talk to us a little bit about what is reputation management and why should B2B advertisers care?
 Great question. So obviously we wrote the whole book on that reputation King, because it's a very important concept in marketing, sales, advertising, driving conversion, because there's an old saying and we've all heard it a thousand times. We buy from people we know, like, and trust.
 And reputation management is a huge part of creating that trust and that likability reputation management is something that is universal across the web. In other words, when you do a Google search or Bing search, pick your search engine and you put in ABC.com reviews or XYZ product reviews. You're looking for signals of a positive reputation and that's going to come in a couple of ways. That's going to come vis-a-vis top search results. And it's going to come vis-a-vis review stars in those search results. So it could be a Google ads, it could be Google shopping. It could be your website. It could be a third party review site or a number of third party review sites. So really reputation management is making sure that you're visible in a positive way in organic and paid search results. And you have positive reputation on your website, primarily on your homepage category pages and your product pages. Because those are the pages where people are going to be looking for trust signals. Do I trust this website brand product, et cetera. So reputation management is really a plethora of things. It's not just one thing. It's all of that. It's what happens in search and it's what happens in your website.
 And the thing that really cuts me about reputation management is if you do a reputation management poorly or you don't have a strategy around it, your metrics from your LinkedIn advertising or any other marketing, you won't actually see it in the metrics. All you'll see is conversion rate looked fine and then poof, they're gone in the sales cycle. When sales reaches out to them, they don't respond. And it's really difficult to know, like is reputation management a concern? Because as soon as it's a concern, you just never hear from him ever again. Do I kind of have that right?
 Completely people won't say, Oh, I didn't buy from you, or I didn't engage with you, or I didn't take your call or answer your email because you have a bad reputation. Now some people may, but it's going to be the one percenters. The vast majority of just going to ghost you. That's just how it works. So we've all heard of eat expertise, authority and trust. That's the Google eat criteria.
 They've actually added another E which is experience. Google wants to see that you have experience, expertise, authority and trust.
 And trust of course, is part of that reputation management equation. And it helps with your search results. And the reason it's important to Google is because it's important to consumers.
 Google only cares about consumers care about because they know that if they serve up a website or an ad that people don't engage with click on and trust, they gave them a bad source, a bad ad, a bad website, because what Google wants is clicks and conversions. They want to make sure that the consumer is happy with the results they served up. And trust of course, is part of that equation. So you absolutely have to be very, very engaged and proactive in your reputation. And unfortunately a lot of executives kind of push that off to, you know, an underling. You take care of our reviews, you get us a review platform, but the reality is, and this is why we wrote the book, it's for e-commerce executives. Because if you don't own your reputation and take it seriously, then nobody else will. Because quite honestly, they don't care. It's your reputation. It's your brand at stake. It's not theirs.
 It's true. And maybe someone who's like your head of SEO, for instance, maybe they might pick up on some of this and say, Oh, this directly affects me, but it directly affects everyone's marketing, but you may just not know it. You may be like, Oh, that's the sales teams issue or that's SEOs, but it really does. It has its fingers in everything.
 Yeah. It has a ripple effect. It's one of those things where it ripples across everything from search visibility, paid ad performance, click through rates, conversion rates, average order value, bounce rates, lifetime value. All of those are affected by your reputation, whether they're consciously being affected by the consumer or not. People are always thinking about, do I trust this company? Do I trust this brand? And it's just one of those subconscious layers happening underneath that they may not even be aware of, but it's driving their decisions.
 Love it. This is so interesting to me. I read this book about e-commerce and I went, Oh my gosh, I have to have you on my podcast to talk about this for B2B. Like this is not even your ideal audience that you speak to, but it has so much of an effect here. Talk to us a little bit about like what you've seen from B2B and what you would see specifically relating to LinkedIn ads. What can and should we be aware of? What should we be looking for? You know, feel free to go on a tirade here.
 Great question. First of all, about a quarter of our clients are B2B. So we have a lot of B2B online sellers, online stores. So we get very involved in that space. In fact, one of the largest registration, URL registration companies is our client.
 And so reputation reviews, social proof are just as important in B2B as our B2C because we're humans. When we go to work and we're in our B2B environment, we don't suddenly take off our human hat and become something else. We're still looking for the same trust signals, the same credibility, the same points of validity that would cause us to like or prefer or buy from one brand versus another. So the trust signals are the same regardless of who we're selling to B2G, B2B, B2C. Now back to your question about how can we convey that in our LinkedIn ads? Because obviously that's what your audience is all about. Well, show popularity. What is social proof? Social proof is conveyed in basically two ways, either popularity, billions and billions served. Who has that in their signs today?
 McDonald's.
 McDonald's, right? It started out millions and it was billions and now it's billions and billions. That's social proof. What does that mean? That means billions and billions of people have trusted this company.
 I should too. How could billions and billions of people be wrong? So that's one form of social proof. Another obviously is long lines. We all want to go to the popular movies, the popular restaurants, the popular concerts, the popular events. We don't want to be the only ones in the restaurant or the only ones in a bad movie.
 We are looking for popularity. Popularity is a sign of credibility.
 So that's part of social proof. So for example, in your ads, you can show 73,000 clients served or serving 73,000 businesses just like yours.
 Okay. Now that's a whole nother layer because we're serving 73,000 businesses like yours, which means not only is that social proof, but people like me, people in my tribe, people in my group, people in my community are actually using this company. So that's one way you can do it. Another way of social proof, which is more subtle is in business since 1991.
 Well, what does that convey? That means you're stable. You're in it for the long haul. A lot of people must like you, know you and trust you because you've been in business for a long time.
 And of course, another one is 7,462, 4.5 star reviews. So now you're showing the number of reviews and the average star rating very, very easy to do in ads. You show 4.5 stars and you show the number of reviews and that shows both the ranking and social proof vis-a-vis the number of people that have left reviews. So those are some great ways to show social proof, credibility and longevity in your ads in business sense, how many clients served, how many reviews, average star rating. And those don't have to be huge, but they should be there. And by the way, a big pet peeve of mine of talking about ads is making sure that your landing page from that ad reflects the same levels of trust, same assets, same color palettes, same messaging social proof because people want to make sure they're in the right place when they click on that ad and they didn't get hijacked off somewhere else. So you're continuing that flow of credibility authority and social proof through to your landing page.
 Oh, I love that. What I especially love about some of these things that you've shared, you could add these to almost any ads you're running.
 Yes.
 It doesn't encumber your ads too much to show a stars rating and just put that on top of one of the single image ads you're running.
 Yeah.
 Doesn't take up a whole lot of room and it silently conveys that no like and trust.
 Exactly. I mean, we're all the same when we were going to travel, we're going to look at hotels, airlines,
 restaurants. We're going to look at reviews. If we've never been there, if we've never bought from that company, we're looking for social proof.
 You know how many people are endorsing this company, this business, this product? 94% of people statistically look at reviews before they buy a product, 94%.
 So it would just go with the ad. If 94% of people are going to look for reviews before they buy the product, why don't you just give them that upfront in the ad? So they already are pre-suaited to have trust and credibility in the ad to create a higher click through rate. So Dr. Tialdini wrote the book, Influence,
 and he also wrote the book, Presuasion and the book Presuasion is all about setting people up psychologically for the sale, which means putting them in a positive mindset about your brand and or product before they even engage with the landing page or ad. So that's what reviews do. They pre-suede them to have trust in your product, brand and company before they even get to the landing page.
 I love that. All right. So you may have already answered this to a degree, but for us as B2B advertisers, if we know we need to start including some of these things to try to engineer this experience, can you tell us what customers are specifically looking for? What are those signals that they care most about so that we can make sure that we're including those on our landing pages and in our ads?
 Okay. So on the ad, here's some things that you can consider. One is having a picture of the owner, founder, CEO, looking directly at the camera, eye to eye contact, and a genuine smile. Not a fake smile, a genuine smile with a crow feet and the whole thing, right? A genuine smile because that creates likability.
 And again, people buy from people. They always buy from people and they want to trust people. They want to know who they're buying from. They don't trust entities nearly as much as they do companies. You look at Elon Musk. Elon Musk and his social channels are exponentially more popular than the brands channels. Why? They want to know what Elon Musk is saying and doing and thinking, not what Tesla's doing, right? So think about connecting with people on a personal level. Back at Kodak, when I was in sales, I was in enterprise B2B sales with Kodak out of college and we had our full color picture on our business cards printed on Kodak paper, of course. But you wouldn't believe how many people commented on those business cards and how often I got through the gatekeepers because my picture was on my business card. People could connect with me before they even met me. Wow. So that human connection is important. Of course, having the social proof, years in business, number of reviews, average star rating are all important. How many companies served now in the landing page? And this is something that is more and more often missed, but a very critical thing to create trust. And that is putting your phone number in the upper right corner of your landing page and throughout your website. Even if people don't call that number, they just want to know that they can. They want to know that there's somebody on the other end of that number. If they have a question, a problem, a concern, et cetera. People get very nervous with brands that hide behind the website. And it's very difficult, if not impossible to actually talk to a human being. So that's just a little thing. And then put your actual physical address in the footer. They want to know that you have a real building, a real place of business, and that you're headquartered at 123 Main Street, Dubuque, Iowa, or whatever it is. And that they can call you.
 Oh, those are big. Couple of nuance questions here. These are more selfish. I think on my part, we're a small agency and we had an office building, but no one went in, so we ended up scrapping it. And now we all work from home, which means if I go to follow this, I would be putting my number in the corner. I would be putting my address probably at the bottom. Is that a backfire situation? Is that a situation where you're like, yeah, you might not want to put those things on there.
 Yeah. You may not want to do that in a business. If you're working out of the home, having a home address would not be optimal. I would back off of that. But if you have a place of business, even if it's a sweet, a sweet number in a building, that's totally fine. Great. But put yourself in the mind of the consumer. They're just looking for these subtle signals of legitimacy, credibility. Are you real? Can I contact you? If I do want to contact you, are you going to make it really difficult?
 So all of these sound really good. If you have a company who's been in business for a long time and has a lot of reviews, what would you say to newer businesses who don't have years and years and, you know, thousands and thousands served? What are some of those proof points that we could point out that smaller businesses, newer businesses could lean on?
 Sure. So if you're a smaller business and you don't have obviously many years in business, you can get some testimonials from your clients. You can get case studies. For example, in your ad, read three case studies that reflect the success this product, you know, does or brings or offers. So case studies, testimonials, awards.
 So you might have an award from an industry or from a competition or whatever the case, even a better business bureau badge, member of the better business bureau, everybody and anybody can be a member of the better business bureau. And just having that little BBB badge creates trust member of the Lackawanna County chamber of commerce. Okay. That shows that you are part of the community. You're not hiding. You're not a vapor business here today, gone tomorrow, that you're creating you know, engagement in the business community. So BBB chamber of commerce costs very, very little to do, but they just do show what we call trust signals or trust badges and low hanging fruit.
 Yeah, this is fantastic. All right. So we've talked about how to leverage our current reviews. Can you tell us a little bit about how LinkedIn advertisers can build these reviews and where is it important for B to B to be building these reviews?
 Everybody can build reviews. So shopper approved collects reviews for B to B B to C doesn't matter. As long as you are able to buy something and check out on the website, we can fire a review request. If you're not selling something on the website and you can't actually check out, then there's a variety of other review platforms that you can use, but everybody should be collecting reviews and asking every single customer for a review. Because the best time to plant a shade tree is 10 years ago. If you didn't do it 10 years ago, do it today. So you can enjoy that benefit later, but start collecting reviews and not only collect reviews, but use the right review partner that will syndicate and display those reviews. Not only on your website, your homepage, your category page, your product pages, but also in organic and paid search results. So to do that, you need to be a Google review partner. So make sure that the review platform you're using is a Google and being review partner so that those review snippets show up in your Google ads, Bing ads, Google shopping, and organic search results, because that is part of the persuasion and that's a big part of reputation management. In other words, if your reviews only appear on your website, but they don't appear in your ads and organic search results, then people may never go to your website because they don't have the trust and credibility from the search results to even bother going to your website. Think of it this way. If you're doing a search for a product and let's say it's a business product, it's a computer, and you see four Google shopping listings for the same product. Three of them have review stars and ratings and one doesn't. One of them has a 4.7. The other one has a 3.2 of those, which are you going to click on and what you're going to not click on.
 Yeah. You're never going to click on the one that doesn't have anything and you're definitely going to click on the one that has the highest.
 Exactly. And not only the highest, but what the research also shows is that people want to see more reviews. So for example, a 4.5 average star rating with 3000 reviews, many times will outperform a 4.7 with six reviews.
 Wow.
 Social proof.
 Because the assumption is that is much, much more difficult to game or manipulate thousands or hundreds of reviews than it is a handful.
 Makes perfect sense.
 So you really do want to collect as many reviews as possible and start as soon as possible. So you can build up those reviews because the number of reviews is analogous to a long line of the restaurant, right? Popularity. If you only have three or four reviews, really? Is that your cousin, brother and uncle?
 Right. Pretty easy to engineer for.
 Exactly.
 I would say the majority of our clients and probably the majority of listeners are probably SAS software, which makes sense. There there's actually going to be a purchase in there somewhere. So this makes sense for those who don't, maybe they are working specifically with a sales rep, they ink a deal there. Maybe it's more of a service, less of a product. At what point do you suggest asking for the review?
 She always asks review. It's just like asking for a testimonial or a referral. If you are B2B and you're SAS G2 Captera, great platforms. And you can ask people to leave a review on G2 and or Captera just as you can on any other open review platform like Trustpilot or BBB for that matter. BBB is actually an open review platform. So you can ask people, you can send them a link say, Hey, would you mind sending me a review to this review platform? And you can, they can just click that link and go to that platform and leave a review.
 And do you suggest asking for the review as they are signing as they're purchasing or after they've gotten a chance to use the product for a little while, cause I could see someone saying like, I will leave you a review, but I haven't even had a chance to test your product yet.
 Yeah, great question. So there's two types of reviews. If you're an online seller and you have an e-commerce store, there's what they call seller ratings or store reviews, and that's a Google product. And that's a review on your experience with the website. There's also a product review, and that is obviously for the product you bought. So we collect both seller ratings or store reviews, which show up in your Google shopping and your Google ads and your organic search results and on your website and product reviews. So you can review abc.com and the product XYZ widget, and therefore you're getting two reviews. Now, if you've noticed in Google shopping lately, you'll see oftentimes, depending if the store is collecting both a seller rating or a store rating and a product review, now that seller rating is what shows up in the Google trusted store icon. And that's what's powering that Google trusted store icon is the seller rating and the product reviews and for the products. So back to your question, if you're selling products, but you're not an e-commerce store, then yes, give them, you know, a week to get the product, use the product, and then ask for a review.
 Oh, that's gold.
 I recommend following up with text wherever possible because text gets opened at 99% of the time, whereas emails, depending on the familiarity with the brand, et cetera, you might get a 10% open rate. You might get a 15% open rate, but you're never going to get the same open rate as you do with text. No secret. We did. I'm not going to name the brand, but I was CMO of a national franchise and we had 200 locations in 34 States.
 And what we did, it was a brick and mortar franchise, but the majority of the leads came through the website. And so what we did was when we sold the product to the customer at the brick and mortar location, we asked Jim, do you mind leaving us a review? Not at all. Wonderful. Can I send you a text? Absolutely. What's your number? And they would put it in right then and there while the customer is still in the store, they would receive it and they would leave the review before they even left. Why is that important? Because we know that if you ask people in the moment while they're there, the chance of them actually doing the review are virtually a hundred percent. If you do it later, it goes down, but it's that heat of the moment. So, you know, that's the time to ask for review if they're in a store location or you're on the phone with them. And I've had this happen to me before people say, Hey, you know, great doing business. We're at a zoom call or on the phone. Would you mind leaving us your view? Not at all. Can I send you a review request? Absolutely. What's your number?
 Boom. There you go. So that's another way to really increase your review conversion rate.
 That's amazing. So if you have a sales rep who's dealing specifically with someone before they even hop off, give them the same thing.
 Yeah.
 Do you mind reviewing us? Can I send you a text?
 Yeah.
 Oh, that's gold right there.
 Do it in the moment if you can, because then, you know, like I say, the conversion rate is virtually a hundred percent.
 Perfect. I know this is going to be a little bit of a loaded question because you sell a product like this, but how does someone go and get some sort of a review platform that allows them to push a review, ask right to someone's cell phone number?
 Yeah. There's many review platforms. You can look at Vindasta. You can look at trust pilot. You can look at podium podiums, a great one. There's many.
 And we should mention shopper approved, right?
 Cause it's absolutely without saying there.
 So we won't hide the fact that you have a platform that does this. And that would be my recommendation.
 Yeah. If shopper approved, I mean, yeah, we've been talking about shopper approved. We, like I say, about a quarter of our businesses B to B and we are actually the highest rated review platform on the web through G2, Captera, even our competitors, trust pilot on BBB, Google, et cetera. We've been in business since 2010. We're a Google and Bing review partner. And we have the highest review request conversion rate in the business. And we're proud of that. And again, we collect seller and product reviews. And we also collect video reviews. And video reviews are super important because now you've got that customer on camera talking about either their product experience or their experience with the website, and that's much more convincing because you're looking at a human being versus just text.
 Yeah. For those of you who are listening, you heard how hard it was for me to pull out of DJ the opportunity to plug his own product. That was one thing I absolutely loved about his book is it struck me. He was mentioning his competitors just as often, if not more often than his own product. So DJ, I love how non-pushy you are. And it comes through so authentically in the book. So just hat tip to you for that. That's amazing.
 Well, thank you. We, we wrote the book because we wanted to be absolutely transparent and we really wanted to just explain how the reputation industry works and how reviews work, how they're collected, how they're displayed, where they're displayed, how to collect them, when to collect them, the tools to collect them, and really the strategy behind reputation management, not just a list of tools, but really how it works. And you read the book, so you know how deeply we get into strategy and how to create and amplify your brand and your reputation online in paid and organic search results, as well as your website. Because what we really want to do is talk clearly to the executive, to the C-suite and explain how important it is to own and manage and amplify your own reputation. So we really want to be transparent and authentic and just say, here's what it is, make your decisions, but here are the best strategies. And here's what we recommend.
 I love it. And I will definitely recommend reading the book right here at the end. I'm going to tell you exactly how you can go and get your free digital copy or audio book audio, because admittedly how I consumed it. I love audio as all of you as podcast listeners, I'm sure you'll appreciate it. So stick around for just a few more minutes and we'll get you that DJ. Can you share any examples of how reputation management has helped B2B companies?
 Absolutely. So we have one client that had a pretty flat traffic over five years on their website. It was not growing. And then in June, they added our reviews to their website. They were capturing seller and product reviews. And then in the following month, they added our search optimized AI driven Q and A tool. And what the Q and A tool does is it automatically optimizes your product questions and answers for page one search results. So for example, if somebody is asking the question in Google, does the ABC widget float, is the ABC widget waterproof? Does the ABC widget work with the XYZ product? Well, those are very low funnel, high purchase, and 10 search questions. So by optimizing those questions and answers for the featured snippet and page one specifically,
 their traffic went up, believe it or not, 8,000%. And their conversions went up 400%. Why? Because we're combining social proof, ratings and reviews with questions and answers. We're actually making it very easy and fast for the consumer to get their very specific product questions answered both in search and on the website.
 So by doing that, what you've done is you've removed the friction. They no longer have to think, can I trust this website? Can I trust this product? Because we have the reviews and they don't have to wonder, is this going to work for me? Is this the product that I'm looking for? Because your questions are all answered on the website using the Q and A widget and in search using the Google search bar. So does it work? Absolutely. Because at the end of the day, why do we go to Google? Because we have questions. We're looking for answers. We're looking for solutions. We're looking for brands, products, right? We're looking for something to scratch that itch or answer that question. And if we can scratch that itch and answer that question both in search and on the website and make it super fast and super easy to do so, then it goes without saying you're going to get more traffic and more conversions.
 I love it. Thanks so much for sharing that. All right. So the question that I ask everyone I interview, because I really want to know what drives you and what fires you up. Tell us what are you most excited about professionally? And then I'm going to follow up immediately with what are you most excited about personally?
 Okay. Good questions. So professionally, obviously the book reputation King is such a exciting project for me because it's the first and only book written specifically for e-commerce and specifically on reputation management.
 And that has guarded so many positive reviews and so many people saying, wow, I finally get it. I understand the veil has been lifted. I know how this industry works and I know how to build and display a positive reputation, but going into next year, what I'm really excited about is we're building out a community for e-commerce executives where we can help them work with their peers and experts to help grow their business in a variety of ways, traffic conversions, net profits, gross revenue, et cetera. And so we're crafting this really exciting community. We're going to bring in subject matter experts, authors, practitioners, and peers to share knowledge and strategies within the e-commerce community. That's what I'm excited about professionally.
 So cool. And what about personally?
 Personally, I love international travel and planning a trip to Thailand. So excited about that.
 That's pretty amazing. You'll have to let me know how Thailand is because I've never stepped foot on the Asian continent.
 Okay. Well, I was there in 2010 and loved it. Absolutely loved it. It haven't been back since it's been 14 years and he started to go back.
 Love it. Well, DJ, thank you so much for sharing so much value with us today. For those of you who want a free copy of the book, go to reputationking.com. Click the link that says, get me my free copy and you'll have access to it. The same audio book that I listened to and absolutely loved. So check that out. Also tell us again, your podcast and where we can go to listen to that.
 The e-commerce traffic and conversion podcast.
 That's perfect. We'll put all these links right down there in the show notes. So if you're listening to this, just scroll down, check it out. DJ, thank you so much. Is there anything else that you want to impart to us before we bail?
 Think about your reputation as part of your traffic and your conversion equation, because it works in both ways. A positive visible online reputation drives traffic and it also drives revenue and conversions. So don't look over it. Don't gloss over it. Don't think it's a little thing. It's actually a huge thing. And get the book. And by the way, we have this for sale is a hardcover full color version on the website, it's 1995 shipping and handling. You get the book, you get the strategy guide, you get this really cool gold million dollar bill, as I know your kids loved.
 My kids love the golden bill.
 And some other little goodies. It's worth 10 times more than that. And, uh, I just invite you to get the book and delve into this. I think very exciting topic, reputation management.
 And I can second that unboxing the book felt way more special than anything else I've ever unboxed before. So that was an amazing experience. Way to go engineering that.
 Thank you.
 That being said, thanks so much for joining us today and we will send everyone your way and reach out if I can ever be useful or helpful in any way.
