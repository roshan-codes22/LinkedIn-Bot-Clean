Summary:
Lead gen form ads are LinkedIn’s 
cheapest and highest-converting
 ad format for capturing leads, often boosting conversion rates by 
10% to 50%
 compared to traditional landing pages. Instead of sending users off-platform, the form appears directly within the ad—pre-filled with their LinkedIn profile data—making it especially frictionless on mobile. These ads are ideal when the goal is 
volume over depth
, and they’re supported across most formats, including sponsored content and messaging. However, their ease of use can result in prospects forgetting they submitted the form, leading to 
lower lead quality
 if follow-up is delayed.
Despite their high efficiency, lead gen forms come with 
limitations
: they offer less control over branding, lack robust tracking and attribution capabilities, and prevent third-party 
retargeting
 since users never visit your site. You’ll also need an integration (like 
Zapier
, Salesforce, or HubSpot) to automatically pull leads out of LinkedIn. The ideal use case? When you need 
quick wins, lead volume, or list growth
—but if your goal is to build relationships with high-value prospects or gain advanced analytics control, 
sending traffic to a landing page may still be the better move
.
