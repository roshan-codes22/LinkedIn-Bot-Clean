Summary:
Most advertisers 
think
 they’re doing well… until the audit comes. In this episode, AJ Wilcox shares real benchmark data from 400+ LinkedIn Ads accounts to help you answer one crucial question: 
Are your campaigns actually working?
You’ll learn:
The average 
CTR, CPC, and CVR
 across every ad format
What’s “good” vs. “bad” performance for your campaigns
Why cost per click isn’t just about your bid
How to identify if your problem is the 
ad
 or the 
landing page
Why LinkedIn’s dashboard 
lies
 to you (especially with Sponsored Messaging)
And a simple test to know if your offer sucks—or just your form
This is your official LinkedIn Ads 
health check
. Don’t launch another campaign without hearing this first.
