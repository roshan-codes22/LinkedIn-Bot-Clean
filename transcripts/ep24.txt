Summary:
Funnels are the backbone of effective LinkedIn Ads strategy, especially for 
B2B lead generation
. Since LinkedIn’s targeting is best for reaching 
cold audiences
, it’s crucial to design a funnel that nurtures users from 
first touch to conversion
. The key is to avoid pushing a demo or purchase right away—instead, use 
value-first content
 like ebooks, webinars, or checklists to drive initial engagement. From there, move users down the funnel using 
retargeting audiences
, email sequences, and smart segmentation based on how users engage.
To build these sequences effectively, marketers can leverage 
LinkedIn’s native retargeting
, including form opens, video views, and website visits. Combining these with 
CRM integrations
, marketers can identify which audiences convert, when to exclude or advance them in the funnel, and how to craft multi-step journeys. A key metric for success: aim for 
15%+ conversion rates
 on top-of-funnel offers. And when it comes to attribution, consider tracking 
every touchpoint
—not just first or last click—to optimize campaign performance and allocate credit fairly. Done right, LinkedIn Ads become not just a source of traffic, but a 
scalable sales engine
.
