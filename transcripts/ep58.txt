LinkedIn Ads has a lot of options for retargeting and nurturing your prospects. What’s worth using and what isn’t. We’ll talk about all of this in more in this week’s episode of the LinkedIn Ads Show.

Welcome to the LinkedIn Ads Show. Here’s your host, AJ Wilcox.

Hey there LinkedIn Ads fanatics! You’re probably aware that retargeting ads are some of the most powerful ads that you can run, and also one of the cheapest. It’s kind of like a digital marketing superpower. So LinkedIn has had retargeting since 2017. But I’ve never really been all that hot on it for reasons that we’ll get into today. But in the last few years, LinkedIn has given us some really great firepower for nurturing our prospects. We’ll dive into the different retargeting and nurturing strategies that you can use, even right now, to get the best bang for your hard earned marketing budget buck. First, let’s cover the news because there’s been a lot this week. In our Account Based Marketing episode that was episode 56, we talked about the company engagement report. This is when you upload a list of company names into your matched audiences and then you can click into them later to see which individual companies have been seeing your ads and engaging with them. Well, this was always really hard to share with your sales team or your ops team. And you can imagine how valuable that might be to get over to sales or get over to maybe your marketing or sales ops, like, hey, these two companies are really engaging with our stuff, right now, it might be a good time to reach out to them. Well, LinkedIn announced this week that your company engagement report is now going to have a CSV export feature. So now you can download this into Excel and send it around to whomever you’d like. About two weeks ago, LinkedIn announced that they acquired an Israeli company called Oribi. LinkedIn’s own words, they said, “Through the integration of Oribi’s technology into our marketing solutions platform, our customers will benefit from enhanced campaign attribution to optimize the ROI of their advertising strategies. This means that our customers will be able to more easily measure website conversions with automated tags and code free technology, as well as build more effective audiences, all in a way that is privacy first by design.” What this tells me is this is a technology that’s going to help us with attribution and conversion tracking. Basically, a lot of the stuff that we’re losing as cookies go away. So, it all sounds really good on the surface, I’m really excited to see what LinkedIn does with it. Also, I’m sure you’ve all felt the same pain that we have, which is when you go to select an industry in LinkedIn’s company pages, or even on your personal profile, the choices were very limited. I think there were only something like 26 different industries that you could choose. Correct me if I’m wrong on that. Well, something that is absolutely fantastic, LinkedIn reached out and said, Hey, we’re expanding our number of industries that you can claim to over 400 different industries. If you are using industry targeting, this may be a huge help to you. But LinkedIn, and I know you listen, I have a huge ask for you on this one. I noticed when going through all of the new industries that we could select, we couldn’t select SAAS software, and we couldn’t select B2B. Those are two that for the longest time, I’ve really struggled to figure out how we can effectively target SAAS companies on LinkedIn, as well as those who are B2B versus B2C. If there’s any way that we could get those somehow wrapped up in our targeting, or in company page classifications, that would be amazing. You should be able to go right now and start typing any industries that you think you might want to claim within your company page, and LinkedIn will auto populate some of the options there. If you’re curious about all 400, a friend of the show, Brenda Miller, has created a post on LinkedIn that lists out all 400 of them. So we’re going to go ahead and link to that in the show notes below. If you’re curious to check out all the options, definitely check out her post. And Brenda thanks for putting that together. That’s a great resource. And then a note from LinkedIn that in June of this year, 2022, the new industries are going to be released in the campaign manager and we’ll be able to view or add these new options to any campaign. Excellent news that we’re excited for. Alright, excited to jump into retargeting and nurturing. Let’s hit it.

First, I think we have to touch on the principle of what nurturing and what retargeting are supposed to be. The concept here is that it usually takes about seven to ten touches with a brand before someone will add the brand to their consideration set where they’ll actually consider doing business with you. We know that people need multiple touches with your brand to get them into the funnel. We also know that a lot of us on LinkedIn are doing this with products and services that are extremely high consideration and high costs, which means more and more people have to be involved in this purchase decision. We call them the purchase committee. And so you start looking at, okay, everyone needs seven to ten touches. And there’s quite a few people here within the buying committee and so now we’re talking about needing a lot of touches on these people in order to secure them wanting to do business with you, or at least considering. So what is a touch? Well, in my mind, a touch is anytime that someone has some sort of an experience with your brand. That could be as low as they saw an ad on their screen and just took note of it and moved on. Others might be a full, they’ve downloaded an asset of yours, or they visited your webpage and clicked around. I’m wondering how many times you have ads on your prospect screen that they haven’t even taken note of they’ve just scrolled right past. So in that case, we certainly couldn’t call an impression, a touch. Just because LinkedIn charges you for an impression doesn’t mean that it actually sunk in for your prospect. I like to talk about someone’s know, like, and trust factor. If someone’s going to do business with you, they need to know you, like you, and trust you. So think about how you build your know, like, and trust factor for any brand out there. Which brands do you absolutely love? And are you a huge fan of? Which ones will you support publicly without needing to be compensated in some way? Think about how you can copy those things that that brand has done for you to your own marketing so you can be doing that for your prospects. An example of how this principle works for me, about 10 years ago, I was really into Twitter, it was really heating up, I was having great conversations and getting a lot of value out of it. But I also noticed that a lot of my friends and industry colleagues would share content on there. But being a very busy professional and not having the time to read every single article that came through my feed, I set a rule for myself. That was if any one or two times that content was posted in the feed, I wouldn’t worry about it. But if I saw three or more of the people that I follow, all reference the same article or topic, I would take the time to go and actually read it and research it. What I was doing is relying on multiple sources to share something before I found it worthy of my time. I think the same rule applies, like if you talk about popularity in high school. So if you can imagine one person in high school walking around and telling everyone, Hey, everyone, I’m popular, and they say it 1000 times, that doesn’t actually help you believe it. In fact, you might actually believe that that person is the epitome of uncool. On the other hand, if you hear from 1000 Different students that this one student is really cool. She is the coolest girl at school. And even if the people who are talking about it are not the people that you trust, you hear it from enough sources, it starts to really sink in. So we know that when we hear about brands from multiple sources, it’s going to help improve our know like and trust factor with that brand, much faster than if they just keep seeing you from exactly one source. In B2B, we know that someone is probably not yet ready to convert at the bottom of the funnel, the very first time they hear about your brand. So then it requires you to continue to warm up that prospect all the way from when they are cold and maybe have never even heard of you before until they are warm enough that they’re ready to convert at the bottom of the funnel and become a customer or at least get a proposal or consider talking to someone. That ability to warm someone up is something that we can do through continued advertising. But it’s especially powerful when we talk about retargeting those prospects. The lazy marketer will do this by just showing the same ads over and over to the same prospect. And to me, that’s the equivalent of the one person in high school walking around and telling everyone how popular they are. It’s not going to be believable. On the other hand, if that prospect is seeing you on certainly in the LinkedIn feed, maybe they see you across multiple different ad formats. Maybe they get a message from you inside of their sponsored messaging. This just keeps getting stronger and stronger, the more channels that you’re targeting on. So sure, we’re going to advocate running all of your ads on LinkedIn because that’s all we do, but I also understand the value of making sure that that same prospect is seeing you when they log on to Facebook and Instagram and they see you on TikTok and they see you on YouTube. All of these are fantastic channels, and that really increase your know, like, and trust factor very quickly. And they’re not all that expensive. Your job as a marketer is going to be what are the offers that I can come up with that are going to warm someone up and get their attention and nurture them, and maybe even help identify what sort of problems they face so that we can keep solving those in the future. That is a huge job ahead of you. But one that when you solve it, it’s pure gold, and it’s going to pay off for years and years to come. And as your retargeting and nurturing your prospects, it’s important to understand that if you have an offer or ads that aren’t performing or aren’t converting, then you constantly need to be introducing new offers, and you constantly need to be shaking things up.

Website Retargeting

So first off, let’s talk about all the retargeting options that we have here on LinkedIn. First off, we have website retargeting, and this is the one that came out in 2017, which I was really excited about, but it ended up really deflating my sales just because there were so many weaknesses with it. So first off, when you’re retargeting just on LinkedIn, you’re showing ads to people only when they’re on LinkedIn. And as we know, LinkedIn isn’t the platform that the majority of your prospects are spending lots and lots of time on every single day. So that makes it a little bit weaker. If your goal of retargeting is to stay top of mind and stay in front of your prospects, then if you’re only doing it on LinkedIn, you’re leaving a lot of money on the table. When website retargeting first launched, LinkedIn said that those audiences would only store for 90 days. It turns out there was a little bit of an internal mistake where they were actually storing those audiences for longer, it was more like 180 days, which is right on par with Facebook, actually. But when I first saw 90, I went, Man, we’re spending a lot of money on our LinkedIn traffic to retarget it and know that when we add someone to an audience, and it’s only going to stick around for 90 days before rolling over, it doesn’t get me excited enough to actually go and do something about it. Then there was the issue of costs, you know, we were paying $8 to $12 per click. And then when we used LinkedIn retargeting, we were still paying like four to $8 per click, sometimes even more. And so when we talk about retargeting being a good deal, it almost like it wasn’t all that great of a deal. Plus, you need to have at least 300 people in your audience. So if I am doing a retargeting audience based off of just people who’ve clicked on my ads, I have to pay for at least 300 people to make it to my landing page or to my website to cookie them before I can even start advertising. So it was kind of a large hurdle to get over for the smaller advertisers for sure. The larger advertisers no problem. I mean, you get 300 clicks in pretty short measure. But for a smaller company or a smaller spend where 300 clicks per month would be a lot, it makes it a lot harder. So all of that to say that LinkedIn’s website retargeting was never all that great value. But now we add to that the fact that LinkedIn’s website retargeting is all based on cookies, and after the iOS 14 update, when all Apple devices stopped storing third party cookies, we looked at it and said, Oh, there goes half of our traffic, maybe this isn’t all that great. And then add that to the fact that here in the next six to nine months, Chrome is probably going to be treating cookies the same way. So now there goes the other half of your audience. I know you didn’t ask, but for my predictions here, I would say that in the next six to nine months, when Chrome does this, we’re probably going to be left with audience sizes that are maybe 10 to 20% of what they were before the iOS 14 update. And this for sure isn’t a good thing. That means that our retargeting audiences that we’ve built are just a 10th, or maybe a 20th as effective, but I don’t want to paint a picture of all doom and gloom here. For the future. Maybe this isn’t going to be a great long term avenue for you. But in the short term, realize that there may still be some value left. There’s nothing stopping you from right now, even if you haven’t started yet. Go and start building up your LinkedIn website retargeting audiences and get use out of them while you can make hay while the sun is still shining. Okay, so that’s website retargeting.

Event Retargeting

Then there’s something actually really exciting, which is event retargeting. So you can imagine with website retargeting, the technology that we’re relying on is that when someone visits your website, your insight tag fires, and it communicates to LinkedIn who that person is. It allows LinkedIn to see based off of the cookie in their browser on their computer, if they are a LinkedIn member. If they’re logged in LinkedIn can recognize them, then LinkedIn will make a note that that person has, indeed, visited your page and now they can put them into some kind of a retargeting audience. This is all based on the fact that LinkedIn as a third party has to be able to identify who someone is on your website and privacy concerns are going to make that a lot more difficult. But whenever someone takes an action on Linkedin.com, of course, LinkedIn knows. That’s called event retargeting. So you can imagine someone is logged in, LinkedIn knows exactly who they are, they see one of your ads, they click on it, they convert on it, they watch a video, all of these things are things that LinkedIn can tell immediately. They know exactly who. They know exactly when. And as long as they have the server space on the back end, they’re able to track this. This type of retargeting has been going on for years and years on Facebook, Facebook has pioneered it and it’s so so good over there. LinkedIn has been rolling out some of these events that you can retarget over the last several years and honestly, they just keep getting better and better. And the most exciting thing I can mention is that LinkedIn just barely released a new one, that is actually the most powerful of all of them. So we’ll get to that here in a minute, make sure you stick around. So here are some of the events that we can retarget, we’ve been able to retarget, those who have submitted a lead generation form. We can also separately track those who have opened a lead generation form. So that means they have taken enough of an action on an ad that it would trigger the form dropping down. So even if they didn’t actually fill out and submit the form, you’re still getting something from them, which is pretty exciting. But you might say to yourself, ma’am, that’s a pretty big commitment for someone to actually engage with an ad like that, like they want to convert. We’re not getting very many people into our funnel. Okay, I understand you there. And it’s a very valid point. Okay, what about this, we’ve been able to target people who have watched at least 25% of a video ad. That’s pretty cool. So you have these video ads out there. It’s a little janky and difficult to set up for sure. But you have all these videos marked as if someone watches at least 25% of this, add them to this audience. Okay, I can still hear you saying, yeah, but 25%. If I have like a three minute long video, again, I’m capturing next to no one, only those are sticking around for 25% of that. Okay, so this one’s a little bit more exciting. What about those who have visited your company page? Anyone who’s visited your company page, you can add to a retargeting audience. And that, I think is a lot more exciting for sure. Okay, at that point, you may say, All right, well, company page, that means they haven’t necessarily interacted with any of my ads, they could have gone to a company page a different way. Okay, I understand there’s a little bit of a weakness there. But if you’re running an event off of your company page, and someone is marked as interested like they want to attend, ah, we can now add them to a retargeting audience. And that’s pretty cool. They’ve showed enough of an interest in an event that we’ve put on that they’re probably going to be interested in future content as well, around those same topics. That’s pretty powerful.

18:21
Single Image Ad Interactions

All right, that takes us to the one that I told you, I was so excited about. This is the one that just rolled out. This is single image ad interactions. By the time you’re hearing this, you should be able to go into your matched audiences and create a new event. And then if you see single image as one of your options, you know, you have this, I think it’s rolled out to everyone at this point. But if not just wait a couple weeks. As you set this up, you have two different options. You can one retarget anyone who had a paid click interaction. That means they took an action that if you were paying by the click you would have gotten charged for. If that’s a website visits campaign, that’s going to be someone who clicked on your link, which is pretty cool because like we talked about with website retargeting, it’s pretty weak when you are sending someone to your landing page. And then you know that maybe only 10 to 20% of the people who make it to the landing page are even going to make it into that audience. Add to the fact that if your page loads slowly, some people may bounce after they’ve clicked, but when the page doesn’t load as fast as they were hoping, then they just leave. So you’re left with almost no audience to be able to retarget Well, if you have this set up for single image retargeting, what you can do is anyone who clicked on your call to action is going to be put into this audience, whether they make it to your landing page or not, whether their cookie is recognized or not by the time they make it to your website. So this makes it ultra powerful to be able to retarget those who have clicked on your ads. That is really cool in my opinion. But then they’ve stepped it up even one more degree, this is a lot closer to where Facebook has it. If you’re running a single image ad, you can retarget anyone who had any sort of interaction on that ad, that means a like a comment a reshare. they’ve clicked on your company page, maybe they’ve followed your company page from there. This is extremely powerful for noting whether someone has had truly some kind of a touch with your brand. We’re doing quite a bit of testing around the single image interaction and click retargeting. So I’m sure we’ll have more to share with you later.

20:40
Matched Audiences

Let’s move on to another retargeting option that we have called matched audiences. Now website retargeting is technically part of matched audiences. But the part that I get most excited about matched audiences for are the lists that you upload. So this is where you can take a list of people who maybe have converted already on your website, and you can upload them to LinkedIn and target them. You can also upload company lists, and narrow your targeting on those companies to get just those who have had some sort of an interaction with your brand in the past. Where you upload a list of contacts, we’ll call that contact lists. And there’s lots of different ways that you can treat these. You might break up your contact lists by what stage of the funnel they’re in. For instance, if you have a list that you know are all cold contacts. Maybe they’ve had some sort of minor interaction with your brand, or maybe they haven’t had any sort of interaction, and you want them to have an interaction with your brand. Then what you can do is upload these into a campaign. And you can promote a more top of funnel type of offer. Something to get their attention and get them to have a positive view of you. Then, of course, if you have a list of prospects, who are maybe a little bit further down the funnel. Maybe these are those who’ve converted in some way. You can show them maybe more of a mid funnel type of offer. And then maybe you have another list that are further along down the funnel. Maybe those who they’re already in contact with your sales team. Maybe you’ve already given them a proposal, and you’re hoping that this deal closes. Well, maybe you can either promote to them more bottom of funnel type of offer, or just stay in front of them long enough to help them make that decision as they’re talking to their buyers committee. The kinds of lists that you can be thinking of, if you’re not quite sure what you can grab. You can grab a list of your competitors, you can grab a list of your current customers, you could get a list of your past customers, like we talked about, you can have a cold list of prospects, maybe you’re presenting at a show. And the show will give you a list of the people who’ve signed up to attend. Maybe you have a warm opt in list that you can upload and work with. Maybe if you’re using a software like HubSpot that has a direct integration into LinkedIn, you can have a dynamic list where as someone is added to your CRM, they’re automatically added to some sort of a list for retargeting or nurture on LinkedIn. When you go to upload a list to LinkedIn a contact list, one of the things that they have is an offline events list option. I looked into it because I haven’t seen this before and to be honest, I’m not sure how this is different than any other contact list, other than it contains a few extra columns, one about like how much they paid for their ticket, and the ticket purchase timestamp. Because this is an offline event where LinkedIn wouldn’t have any sort of vision into it. I’m not quite sure what value you would get out of matching these details, because LinkedIn won’t know how much someone paid for their ticket, or won’t know when a ticket was purchased. But maybe in the future, this could be used for like optimizing ads towards people who paid more for their tickets. So maybe they’re a higher quality prospect. I don’t know how this is working, but if you’re not sure on how to use this one, and you are using offline events, just upload it as a normal contact list and you’ll be good. I mentioned that we were doing some cool research around the single image interactions. And what we did is we went and created a separate audience, for those who have interacted with an ad in the last 30 days, the last 60 days, the last 90 days, the last 180 days, and the last 365 days. And what’s so cool to me about this is something that Facebook has done that I honestly didn’t think that LinkedIn was going to do. It will actually build these audiences in arrears. What I mean by that is if you go in right now and you set up one of these audiences to target anyone who’s clicked on one of your ads for the last 30 days. Yoou know you create the campaign today, it’ll take the full 72 hours to build that audience, and then it will actually go and put all of the people who’ve interacted with that ad in the last 30 days. In that audience. It goes back and grabs them, even from before they have this option, really cool. What I love about this is you can actually go and create all five of these audiences and you can even double them. You know, 30 days of interacting with the ad and 30 days clicking on it, and then 60 days interacting with the ad, and then 60 days clicking on it. You could create 10 separate audiences that you can use. And what I love about this is that you can actually graduate people through these funnels now. So if it’s just tracking people who’ve interacted in the last 30 days, after 30 days passes, they will fall out of that audience, but they’ll still be in the 60 day audience. So you could create different campaigns that pick someone up after they’ve not interacted with your brand in a while and try to warm them back up. It is important to remember that you still need at least 300 unique audience members in each in order for the ads to run, but set them up now, so that they’re all ready to go once you have that many clicks. As we went and built these, we noticed that LinkedIn will tell us the number of engagements that an individual audience had. And then after the list processes, it told us a smaller number of people who are now in that audience. And the way that I interpreted that for one of our clients, it said that there were something like 11,800 engagements from that audience as we were building the segment. And then after it was done, it produced a list of 7,200 users. That tells me that, yeah, 7,200 people were responsible for those 11,800 engagements, which means that on average, each person in an audience was responsible for almost two engagements. That tells us a little bit about the frequency that we’re hitting them on, which is pretty cool. Okay, we’re gonna take a quick sponsor break, and then we’ll dive into the general nurture strategies that we can use.

Top of Funnel

Okay, let’s jump into some of the different nurturing strategies that we can use now that we know about the different tools that LinkedIn has given us to retarget people. I think first we need to talk about those who are top of funnel. So these are cold prospects, maybe they’ve seen your company at some point, or maybe they’ve taken some light action. There’s a couple different strategies I might recommend. The first and lightest would be, you could put some kind of an offer together that’s ungated and show it to them in hopes that you’re just going to get them exposed positively to your brand. This, as we’ve talked about on previous episodes, is a very expensive strategy on LinkedIn, because you’re going to pay $8 to $13 per click for people to go to a blog post or go to an ungated asset. There isn’t a great way of staying in front of them on other platforms. We know if you send them to a landing page, and you’re retargeting on Google and on Facebook, and you’ve got your LinkedIn retargeting set up, then you’ll have a better chance, but it won’t be bulletproof, for sure. All of those clicks will add up to something where you’re not even asking them to convert. So you may not have that vote of knowing whether or not this is working because you’re not seeing conversions come in. You could do a step up, which is you could gate that content. Showing them offers like free guides and checklists and cheat sheets, where they do have to enter in their personal information. This tends to be one of the strategies that we recommend the most for newer advertisers. And then you could take some of these event retargeting, as well as your website retargeting and show similar offers, or maybe even the same offer to those who haven’t converted. And this is even stronger because of that new single image event retargeting because we can target those who clicked, but didn’t convert, especially if it’s like a lead gen form. If they need more warming up, you can always promote a more top of funnel or middle of funnel offer before jumping into a bottom of funnel offer. So what I mean by this is, let’s say that you are running someone through a three stage funnel. So there’s a top of funnel piece of content like a free guide, then the next offer they’re introduced to might be something a little bit higher engagement, like join a webinar or an online event. And then your final step in the funnel might be talk to someone, set up a call, get a demo. Well, if you’re running this and you notice that your sales team is talking about these being low conversion rate from MQL to SQL, or the leads just aren’t ready yet, you could always insert one more step in there. You can say, Okay, we’re going to try to top of funnels, or we’re going to try a top of funnel and then to middle of funnel offers, before jumping them writes that bottom of funnel. Now I have to tell you, this is absolutely revolutionary that we can do this on LinkedIn, we didn’t used to be able to create these bulletproof funnels, but now we can. We can start building these audiences of just those who’ve interacted with certain content. It’s way cool. The kinds of offers that you might consider for cold audiences might be something like a blog post, or an infographic that or ungated. Or the kinds of things that might be gated could be things like a free checklist, or cheat sheet, a guide, an ebook, maybe even something like a webinar, or an in person event, those are getting a little bit more high engagement and high friction, I get asked a lot about case studies promoting case studies, either for the middle of funnel or top of funnel, or even bottom of funnel. And what I do is I split case studies into two different camps because there’s two different really kinds of case studies, I have one that is more of a sales piece, and then one that’s more of a guide. So if you look at your case studies, and you say, oh, what this is really saying is, look how awesome my company is, because we’ve had this success with this awesome client, then that’s a sales case study and I would say that is already very bottom of funnel. You’re not going to want to gate something like that near the top or middle of your funnel, because the only time someone would actually be interested in that kind of content would be if they’re already considering doing business with you and they just want some proof that you are legit, that you are who you say you are. But if you have a case study that’s very much like, Hey, here’s the problem we face, and here are the concrete steps that we went through in order to get this outcome, and here’s the outcome we had, and here were the things we tried, and the things that didn’t work and did work. Now you can follow this exact same guide and get exactly the same outcome. You could still call it a case study, but I might also call it a guide or a checklist. And that is actually going to be valuable for everyone, even top of funnel. So take a look at your different case studies and see which of those categories yours falls under. If you’re more middle of funnel with these prospects with a list that you’re working on, I think you can go to the more high touch, the more high friction types of offers out there. So you might consider a webinar or a sales in case study or an in person event. And then when you get to the bottom of the funnel, that’s obviously when you earned your spot to be able to ask them for things like talk to a sales rep, buy now, take a free trial of your software. Really anything that earlier stages in the funnel, they’re not going to be ready for yet. So maybe you’re thinking to yourself, hey, AJ, should I be setting up some sort of a retargeting campaign on LinkedIn? Should my company be nurturing? The answer is, absolutely, I don’t care who you are. Everyone should be running retargeting in some form or another. There’s no excuse not to at least get it setting up and building audiences so even if you’re not ready to use them right now, you can still use them in the future. Remember with those website retargeting audiences, if you don’t have that setup now and gaining audience members, every day that you put off doing that you’re losing people in your audience, whereas with the single image retargeting that LinkedIn just gave us, and I hope they roll this kind of functionality out to all of their events, we really can set that up at any point in time, just realize that there is a 72 hour processing time.

Sequences

So now we have this ability to run people through sequences. We can sequence them by how long ago, they committed some sort of an action, and then graduate them to the next step, once they’ve either taken a certain action, or it’s just been longer than 30 days or whatever. If you’re just brand new to this and let’s say that some of your lists, you don’t have enough people in them to run ads by themselves. What I would suggest doing is stacking your lists. What you might say is in one campaign, one beautiful retargeting campaign, you’re going to have anyone who’s watched at least 25% of your video ads. And then you add to that anyone who’s opened a lead gen form. You can also add company page visitors. And you can do this until each segment of your audience is large enough to run on its own or just keep them combined if you only want one retargeting audience to stay in front of all of them, rather than having to run five or six different campaigns. If you’re looking to build an audience as fast as possible, the fastest way to do this is still to run a short video ad, lets say something that is eight seconds or there abouts, and target anyone who’s watched at least 25% of that video, then trigger showing them the next ad. That’s the fastest way to build a retargeting audience. Now I mentioned ways of retargeting people and interacting with them off of LinkedIn. We call this maybe a holistic retargeting strategy, or a holistic marketing strategy. If you want to retarget on Google when you get people to your website, it’s the same minimum that LinkedIn has, you have to have at least 300 people in an audience, but what you do get is access to incredible inventory. You have access to all of Googles Google Display Network, which is like 80% of the web out there. If your goal in retargeting is to stay in front of someone, and keep top of mind, there’s no better way than on Google to do that. You get them everywhere that they are surfing around and looking for information. Then you’ve got Facebook, which last time I checked, the minimum to run a Facebook retargeting audience was like 20 people so much, much lower than LinkedIn and Google’s 300 person minimum. That makes it an incredible place to start retargeting because you don’t need very many visitors before you can start doing that. Of course, you can do email nurture, which is kind of like retargeting, but once you have someone’s email address, you’re retargeting them through their email inbox. Which you’re obviously not doing through an ad platform, you would do that through your email provider or through your marketing automation software, but it’s a great way of just having one additional touch with your brand. We’ve talked a little bit about how retargeting is taking a hit on LinkedIn with the cookie going away. And it’s true retargeting has definitely taken a hit. And this is not just limited to LinkedIn, Facebook and Google are absolutely reeling, trying to figure out what’s the best way that they can keep their retargeting technologies working because once those cookies are gone, they lose so many of the ways that they get signals on who’s interacting with ads. But I will say Facebook and Google are still the most advanced ad platforms on the planet and if anyone can solve it, it is them. No matter whether you’re currently advertising on Google and or Facebook right now, go set up your retargeting audiences so that they’re building so that you can do this in the future. Because again, if you don’t get it set up, now, you’re losing all of those people who would be interacting today. All right, I’ve got the episode resources coming for you right up. So stick around.
